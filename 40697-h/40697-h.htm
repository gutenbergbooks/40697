<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Heidelberg</span> seems
rather a tourist-ridden,
hackneyed sort of place
to be the mother of adventures.
Nevertheless, it is there that my
story begins. I had been traveling
on the Continent, and came
to Heidelberg to pay my duty to
the castle, and recruit in quiet
after a spell of rather laborious
idleness at Homburg and Baden.
At first sight I made up my mind
that the place would bore me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
I came down to dinner at the
hotel, looking forward only to a
bad dinner and an early bed.
The room was so full that I could
not get a table to myself, and, seeing
one occupied only by a couple
of gentlemanly looking men, I
made for it, and took the third
seat, facing one of the strangers,
a short, fair young man, with
a little flaxen mustache and a
soldierlike air, and having the
other, who was older, dark, and
clean-shaved, on my left. The
fourth seat was empty.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen returned
my bow with well-bred negligence,
and I started on my soup.
As I finished it, I looked up and
saw my companions interchanging
glances. Catching my eye, they
both looked away in an absent
fashion, each the while taking out
of his pocket a red silk handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and laying it on the table
by him. I turned away for a
moment, then suddenly looked
again and found their eyes on
me, and I fancied that the next
moment the eyes wandered from
me to the handkerchiefs. I happened
to be carrying a red handkerchief
myself, and, thinking
either that something was in the
wind or perhaps that my friends
were having a joke at my expense
(though, as I said, they looked
well-bred men), I took it out of
my pocket and, laying it on the
table, gazed calmly in front of
me, my eyes naturally falling on
the fair young man.</p>

<p>He nodded significantly to the
older man, and held out his hand
to me. I shook hands with him,
and went through the same ceremony
with the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
speaking in French, &ldquo;you got her
letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you are willing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first maxim for a would-be
adventurer is always to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
to questions. A &ldquo;no,&rdquo; is fatal to
further progress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be made worth your
while, of course,&rdquo; he went on.</p>

<p>I thought I ought to resent this
suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you cannot possibly
mean to suggest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;ladies have their own ways of
paying debts. If you don&rsquo;t like
it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, smiling, &ldquo;I misunderstood
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, of course,&rdquo; said the older
man, speaking for the first time,
and in a loud whisper, &ldquo;of vital
importance that His Royal
Highness&rsquo; name should not appear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This really began to be mysterious
and interesting. I nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That goes without saying,&rdquo;
said the young man. &ldquo;And
you&rsquo;ll be ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But
when?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you? Oh, six
o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s early hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you must, you know,&rdquo;
he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; added the older man,
&ldquo;the countess hopes you&rsquo;ll come
to breakfast afterward at ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there, never fear,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s very kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said the young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
clapping me on the shoulder (for
we had risen from table). &ldquo;You
take it the right way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As may be supposed, I was
rather puzzled by this time, and
decidedly vexed to find I should
have to be up so early. Still, the
mention of His Royal Highness
and the countess decided me to
go on for the present; probably
the real man&mdash;for, unless it were
all a mad joke, there must be a
real man&mdash;would appear in the
course of the evening. I only
hoped my new friends would, in
their turn, take it in the right
way when that happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a servant with
you?&rdquo; asked the young man, as
we said good-night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I am quite
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a paragon of prudence,&rdquo;
he answered, smiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll call you, and we&rsquo;ll slip
out quietly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as I was getting into bed,
the waiter knocked at my door and
gave me a note. It bore no address.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it for me?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You
are the gentleman who dined with
Herr Vooght and M. Dumergue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I supposed I was, and opened
the note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are generous and forgiving,
indeed,&rdquo; it said (and said it in
English). &ldquo;What reward will you
claim? But do be careful. He
is dangerous.&mdash;M.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>The next morning I was
aroused at five o&rsquo;clock by my two
friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Herr Vooght,&rdquo;
said I, looking just between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; answered the
older man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear fellow, come
along. There&rsquo;s a cup of coffee
downstairs,&rdquo; said the other, whom
I took to be Dumergue.</p>

<p>After coffee, we got into a close
carriage with a pair of horses, and
drove two or three miles into the
country; my companions said
little. Dumergue twice asked in
a joking way how I felt, and
Vooght puzzled me very much by
remarking:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are bringing all the
necessaries; but I don&rsquo;t know
what they will choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When this was said, Dumergue
was humming a tune. He went
on for five minutes, and then said,
with a touch of scorn:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good Vooght, they know
our friend&rsquo;s reputation. They
will choose pistols.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not repress a start.
No doubt it was stupid of me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
not to have caught the meaning
of this early expedition before,
but it really never struck me that
our business might be a duel.
However, so it seemed, and apparently
I was one of the principals.
Dumergue noticed my little start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they know my name?&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friend, could you
expect the baron to fight with an
unknown man? The challenge
had to be in your name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had clearly been the challenger.
I was consumed with
curiosity to know what the grievance
was, and how the countess
was concerned in the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The countess assured us,&rdquo;
said Vooght, &ldquo;that she had your
authority.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As fully as if I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
there,&rdquo; I answered, and Dumergue
resumed his tune.</p>

<p>I was sincerely glad that the
name of my original had been
given, for his reputation for
swordsmanship had evidently
saved me from a hole in my skin.
I was a fair hand with a pistol;
but, like most of my countrymen,
a mere bungler with the rapier.
It was very annoying, though, that
my friends&rsquo; exaggerated prudence
prevented them mentioning my
name: it would have been more
convenient to know who I was.</p>

<p>I had not long for reflection,
for we soon drew up by a roadside
inn, and, getting out of the carriage,
walked through the house,
where we were apparently expected,
into a field behind. There
were three men walking up and
down, and two of them at once
advanced to meet Vooght and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Dumergue. I remained where I
was, merely raising my hat, and
the third man&mdash;a big, burly fellow,
with a heavy black mustache&mdash;followed
my example.</p>

<p>This one, no doubt, was the
baron. To be frank, he looked a
brute, and I had very little hesitation
in assuming that the merits
of the quarrel must be on my side.
I was comforted by this conclusion,
as I had no desire to shoot
an unoffending person. Preliminaries
were soon concluded. I
overheard one of the baron&rsquo;s
representatives mention the word
apology, and add that they would
meet us halfway, but Dumergue
shook his head decisively. This
defiant attitude became Dumergue
very well; but I, for my part,
should have been open to reason.</p>

<p>The baron and I were placed
opposite one another at twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
paces. There were to be two
shots&mdash;unless, of course, one of
us were disabled at the first fire;
after that, the seconds were to
consider whether the matter need
go further.</p>

<p>The word was just about to be
given, when to my surprise the
baron cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone looked at him in
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we fire,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;I wish to ask this gentleman
one question. No&mdash;I will not be
stopped!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His seconds, who had advanced,
fell back before his resolute gesture,
and he continued, addressing
me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, will you do me the honor
to answer one question? Are
you the person who accompanied&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Vooght struck in quickly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No names, please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The baron bowed, and began
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On your honor, sir, are you
the gentleman who accompanied
the lady in question to the masked
ball on the night in question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>These gentlemen were all diplomatic.
I thought I would be
diplomatic too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely this is grossly irregular?&rdquo;
I said, appealing to my
supporters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask for an answer,&rdquo; said the
baron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but a new insult,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have my reasons, and those
gentlemen know them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was intolerable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean to fight, or you don&rsquo;t,
M. le Baron,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Which is
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your master is well served,&rdquo;
he said with a sneer.</p>

<p>His seconds looked bewildered:
Vooght bit his nails, and Dumergue
swore furiously, and, coming
near me, whispered in my ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoot straight! Stop his
cursed mouth for him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had not the least intention of
killing the baron, if I could avoid
it without being killed myself;
but I thought a slight lesson would
improve his manners, and, when
the word came, I fired with a careful
aim. He evidently meant mischief,
for I heard his ball whiz
past my ear; I missed him clean,
being much out of practice, and,
I dare say, rather nervous. I
pulled myself together for the
second shot, for I saw that my
opponent was not to be trifled
with, and I should not have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the least surprised to find myself
in paradise the next moment. On
the word I fired; the baron fell
back with a cry, and simultaneously
I felt a tingle in my left
hand, and the unmistakable warm
ooze of blood. The witnesses ran
to my opponent, and raised his
head. Dumergue turned round
to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A scratch,&rdquo; I answered, for I
found the ball had run up my
arm, merely grazing me in its
passage.</p>

<p>A hurried consultation followed;
then Vooght and Dumergue raised
their hats and joined me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had best be off,&rdquo; said
Vooght.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dumergue, with a
little disappointment, I thought.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get over it; but he&rsquo;s safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
for a week or two. Not a bad
shot, colonel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I was a colonel!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Vooght, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
drive back, and send you to the
countess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had made up my mind to get
away from the place as soon as I
could, but my curiosity to see the
<i lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">causa belli</i> was too strong, and I
said I should be delighted to keep
my engagement.</p>

<p>Dumergue smiled significantly,
and Vooght hurried us into the
carriage. We drove back to the
town, and then two or three miles
into the country again, till we
came to a pretty villa, embowered
in trees, and standing some two
hundred yards back from the
road. There was no drive up to
the house, a turf walk forming
the passage from the highway.
Vooght motioned me to get down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you accompany me?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>Dumergue smiled again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come
for us at the hotel, and we&rsquo;ll
all be off by the two o&rsquo;clock
train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless you are detained,&rdquo;
added Vooght.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be detained, if I
were you,&rdquo; said Dumergue dryly.
&ldquo;Who knows? The baron may
die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was quite determined not to
be detained, and said so. I was
also quite determined not to keep
the rendezvous at the hotel, but
to slip away quietly by myself.
The colonel might arrive at any
moment.</p>

<p>I watched my friends drive off,
and then walked briskly up to the
house. A man in livery met me
before I had time to ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the gentleman?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be so kind, sir, as to
walk straight in? That door, sir.
The countess expects you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had my doubts about that, but
I walked in, shutting the door
swiftly behind me, lest the servant
should hear anything. I thought
an explosion not improbable.</p>

<p>The room was dim, close curtains
shutting out the growing
strength of the sunshine. The
air was thick with the scent of
flowers that overpowered without
quite smothering the appetizing
smell rising from a table profusely
spread for breakfast. I had entered
softly, and had time to take
note of the surroundings before
I became aware of a tall, slight
figure in white, first moving impetuously
toward me, then stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
abruptly in surprise. Presumably,
this was the countess. Charming
as she was, with her open blue
eyes, fluffy golden hair, and fresh
tints, I wondered from what noble
house she sprang. However, the
fountains of honor are many, and
their streams meander sometimes
through very winding channels.</p>

<p>The countess stood and looked
at me. I bowed and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are naturally surprised,&rdquo;
I said, in my smoothest tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was expecting&mdash;another
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. I come in his
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In his place?&rdquo; she repeated,
in incredulous tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; in the colonel&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;We
needn&rsquo;t mention names.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It suited me perfectly not to
mention names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; I murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how is it possible?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;Do you know what he
was to come for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he hasn&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She frowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t. So I came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did you know anything
about it? Did he tell you
about the pr&mdash;about the affair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I only heard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that you wanted a champion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s absurd! Why, you
never heard of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed I have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;did you recognize me
under my new name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My&mdash;my title. You know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;he told me that. Must
I confess? I jumped at the chance
of serving you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had never seen me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I had seen your
photograph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled at this, but still
looked perturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t be distressed,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;I am very discreet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope so! The prince
[she spoke in a whisper] was so
urgent about discretion. You
haven&rsquo;t seen him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prince? No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;when is it to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand.&rdquo;
This was my first truthful remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the duel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all over!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;two hours ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the baron? No, forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
me. You! Are you
hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. He&rsquo;s hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; she asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, countess. Not
quite. Was that necessary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Though he deserved
it. He insulted me shamefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he did deserve it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went off at a tangent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What became of my letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They gave it to me. You
only said for the gentleman who
dined with your friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you read it?&rdquo; she asked,
blushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. How I wish I were the
rightful owner of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he come?&rdquo; she
asked again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to write and explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you really came because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I tell you already? Or
have you guessed already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She blushed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what else the
prince could do, you know,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;He ought, of course,
never to have gone to the ball at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; I answered;
&ldquo;but I suppose he was tempted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think very badly of
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you perfection
if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would give me some
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a shame! You&rsquo;re
starving! And after all you have
done! Come, I&rsquo;ll wait on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My meal was very pleasant.
The lady was charming; she satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
every feeling I had, except
curiosity. She was clearly English;
equally clearly she was involved
with some great people on
the Continent. I gathered that
the baron had insulted her, when
she was with the prince, and the
latter could not, whether for state
or domestic reasons, espouse the
quarrel. So far I got, but no
farther.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a debt I owe you!&rdquo; she
said, as she led the way after
breakfast to the top of a little
tower. An awning was spread
overhead, and armchairs on the
floor. A cool breeze blew, and
stirred her hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am more than paid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fancy, if you had been
hurt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better I than the colonel!&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>

<p>She darted a smile at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you
came, and he didn&rsquo;t. I like you
best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all very charming, but
time was flying, and I began to
plan a graceful exit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make it hard to go,&rdquo; I
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose we must go as
soon as possible. Herr Vooght
said at two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was startled. Delightful as
she was, I hardly reckoned on her
being one of the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prince will be so pleased
to see you,&rdquo; she went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you will have my recommendation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it must be all-powerful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we have two hours before
we need start. You must want to
rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a charming tower this
is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; such a view. Look, we
can see for miles. Only I hate
that stretch of dusty road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked carelessly toward
the road along which we had
come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look what a dust!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a carriage! Oh, they&rsquo;ll upset!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I jumped up. About half a
mile off, I saw a carriage and pair
driven furiously toward the villa.
My heart beat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Possibly the authorities have
found out about the duel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in case I have to slip
away&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go alone. You will
join us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But now, in case&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a reward, may I kiss your
hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave it me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you came,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Stay, perhaps it&rsquo;s only our
friends coming for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was reluctant to cut short our
good-by,&mdash;for I feared it must be
final,&mdash;but no time was to be lost.
With another kiss&mdash;and upon my
honor, I can&rsquo;t swear whether it
was her hand or her cheek this
time&mdash;I rushed downstairs, seized
my hat and cane, and dived into
the shrubberies that bordered on
the turf walk. Quickly I made
my way to within twenty yards of
the road, and stopped, motionless
and completely hidden by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
trees. At that moment the carriage,
with its smoking horses,
drew up at the gate.</p>

<p>Dumergue got out; Vooght
came next; then a tall, powerful
man, of military bearing. No
doubt this was the colonel. They
seemed in a hurry; motioning the
driver to wait, they walked or
almost ran past me up the path.
The moment they were by me and
round a little curve, I hastened to
the gate, and burst upon the
driver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred marks to the
station!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, sir, I am engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn you! Two hundred!&rdquo;
I cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; said he, like a sensible
man, bundling back the nose-bags
he was just putting on his
horses. I leaped in, he jumped on
the box, and off we flew quicker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
even than they had come. As we
went, I glanced up at the tower.
They were there! I saw Vooght
and Dumergue lean over for a
moment, and then turn as if to
come down. The tall stranger
stood opposite the lady, and
seemed to be talking to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faster!&rdquo; I cried, and faster
and faster we went, till we reached
the station. Flinging the driver
his money, I took a ticket for the
first train, and got in, hot and
breathless. As we steamed out of
the town, I saw, from my carriage-window,
a neat barouche with a
woman and three men in it, driving
quickly along the road, which
ran by the railway. It was my
party! Youth is vain, and beauty
is powerful. I bared my head,
leaned out of the window, and
kissed my hand to the countess.
We were not more than thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
yards apart, and, to my joy, I saw
her return my salutation, with a
toss of her head and a defiant
glance at her companions. The
colonel sat glum and still; Vooght
was biting his nails harder than
ever; Dumergue shook his fist at
me, but, I thought, more in jest
than in anger. I kissed my hand
again as the train and the carriage
whisked by one another, and I
was borne on my way out of their
reach.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="f9">At the Hôtel Magnifique.</span></h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="68" height="70" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">To</span> a reflective mind nothing
is more curious than the
way one thing leads to
another. A little experience of
this tendency soon cured me of
refusing to go anywhere I was
asked, merely because the prospects
of amusement were not very
obvious. I always went&mdash;taking
credit of course for much amiability&mdash;and
I often received my
reward in an unexpected development
of something new or an
interesting revival of a former
episode. It happened, a few
months after my adventure at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Heidelberg, that my brother&rsquo;s
wife, Jane Jason, asked me, as a
favor to herself, to take a stall at
the theater where a certain actress
was, after a long and successful
career in the provinces, introducing
herself to a London audience.
Jane is possessed by the idea that
she has a keen nose for dramatic
talent, and she assured me that
her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i> was a wonder. I dare
say the woman had some talent,
but she was an ugly, gaunt creature
of forty, and did not shine in
<cite>Juliet</cite>. At the end of the second
act I was bored to death, and was
pondering whether I knew enough
of the play to slip out without
Jane being likely to discover my
desertion by cross-examination,
when my eye happened to fall on
the stage-box in the first tier. In
the center seat sat a fair, rather
stout man, with the very weariest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
expression that I ever saw on
human face. He was such an unsurpassed
impersonation of boredom
that I could not help staring
at him; I could do so without
rudeness, as his eyes were fixed on
the chandelier in the roof of the
house. I looked my fill, and was
about to turn away, and go out
for a cigarette, when somebody
spoke to me in a low voice, the
tones of which seemed familiar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, impostor, here you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Dumergue, smiling
quietly at me. I greeted him with
surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is the baron?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He cheated the&mdash;grave,&rdquo; answered
Dumergue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the countess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! I have a message for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From her?&rdquo; I inquired, not, I
fear, without eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;from the
prince. He desires that you
should be presented to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot. Prince Ferdinand
of Glottenberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! He&rsquo;s in London,
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in that box,&rdquo; and he
pointed to the bored man, and
added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along; he hates being
kept waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looks as if he hated most
things,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, most things are detestable,&rdquo;
said Dumergue, leading the
way.</p>

<p>The prince rose and greeted me
with fatigued graciousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much indebted
to you, Mr. Jason,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I began to stammer an apology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
for my intrusion into his
affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; he resumed, without
noticing what I said, &ldquo;a moment&rsquo;s
bewilderment. I quite enjoyed
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed, and he continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only things I cling to in
life, Mr. Jason, are a quiet time at
home and my income. You have
been very discreet. If you hadn&rsquo;t,
I might have lost those two things.
I am very much obliged. Will you
give me the pleasure of your company
at supper? Dumergue, the
princess will be delighted to see
Mr. Jason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, Her Royal Highness
will be delighted,&rdquo; answered
Dumergue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was the princess going?&rdquo;
asked the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To a meeting of the Women&rsquo;s
International Society for the Promotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of Morality, at the Mansion
House, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; said the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Majesty is much interested
in the society, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure my brother would
be. Come along, Mr. Jason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince and princess were
staying at the Hôtel Magnifique
in Northumberland Avenue. We
drove thither, and were told that
the princess had returned. Upon
further inquiry, made by Dumergue,
it appeared that it would
be agreeable to her to sup with the
prince and to receive Mr. Jason.
So we went into the dining room
and found her seated by the fire.
After greeting me, she said to the
prince:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just written a long
account of our meeting to the
king. He will be so interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was a small woman, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
gentle manner and a low, sweet
voice. She looked like an amiable
and intelligent girl of eighteen,
and had a pretty, timid air, which
made me wish to assure her of my
respectful protection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; said the prince,
&ldquo;is a man of catholic tastes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is necessary in a king, sir,&rdquo;
suggested Dumergue.</p>

<p>The prince did not answer him,
but offered his arm to his wife, to
escort her to the table. She motioned
me to sit on her right hand,
and began to prattle gently to me
about the court of Glottenberg.
The prince put in a word here and
there, and Dumergue laughed appreciatively
whenever the princess&rsquo;
descriptions were neat and
appropriate&mdash;at least, so I interpreted
his delicate flattery.</p>

<p>I enjoyed myself very much.
The princess was evidently, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
judge from her conversation, a
little Puritan, and I always love a
pretty Puritan. That rogue Dumergue
agreed with all her views,
and the prince allowed his silence
to pass for assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do try at court,&rdquo; she
ended by saying, &ldquo;to set an example
to society; and, as the king
is unmarried, of course I have to
do a great deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment, a servant entered,
bearing a card on a salver.
He approached the princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gentleman desires the
honor of an audience with Her
Royal Highness,&rdquo; he announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this time of night!&rdquo; exclaimed
the princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says his business will not
bear delay, and prays for a interview.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All business will bear delay,&rdquo;
said the prince, &ldquo;and generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
be the better for it. Who is
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Baron de Barbot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I must see him,&rdquo; cried
the princess. &ldquo;Why, he is a dear
friend of ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had detected a rapid glance
pass between Dumergue and the
prince. The latter then answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must see Barbot. If
you will go to the drawing room,
I&rsquo;ll take your message myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is kind of you,&rdquo; said the
princess, retiring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the card,&rdquo; said the
prince, &ldquo;and ask the baron to be
kind enough to wait a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant went out, and the
prince turned to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you kill him, Mr.
Jason?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s your baron,&rdquo; said
Dumergue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a little awkward,&rdquo;
said the prince, as though gently
remonstrating with fate. &ldquo;We
had arranged it all so pleasantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would upset the princess,&rdquo;
said Dumergue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What upsets the princess upsets
me,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I am
a devoted husband, Mr. Jason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there is anything I can do,
sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;rely on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You overwhelm me,&rdquo; said the
prince. &ldquo;Is there anything, Dumergue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, sir. Mr. Jason was
at the ball. Why should he have
fought, if he wasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, Dumergue.
Mr. Jason, you were at the ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, sir, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know anything
about the ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just like other balls&mdash;other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<em>masked</em> balls,&rdquo; said Dumergue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a little more so,&rdquo;
added the prince, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a scandal at the
last one,&rdquo; Dumergue continued,
&ldquo;and the king strictly forbade
anyone connected with the court
to go, under pain of his severe
displeasure. There had been a
rumor that a royal prince was at
the one before, and consequently&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That royal prince was specially
commanded not to go to this one,&rdquo;
said the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was bad enough,&rdquo; resumed
Dumergue, &ldquo;that it should be discovered
that the princess&rsquo; favorite
lady-in-waiting, the Countess
von Hohstein&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who bore such a high character,&rdquo;
interjected the prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did go, and, moreover, went
under the escort of an unknown
gentleman&mdash;a gentleman whose
name she refused to give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that discovered?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was. This baron detected
her, and, with a view, as we have
reason to believe, to compelling
her companion to declare himself,
publicly insulted her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereupon,&rdquo; said the prince,
&ldquo;you very properly knocked him
down, Mr. Jason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The princess,&rdquo; continued
Dumergue, &ldquo;was terribly agitated
and annoyed at the scandal and
the duel which followed. And of
course the countess left the court,
and returned to England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To England?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; she was a Miss Mason.
The king ennobled her at the
princess&rsquo; request.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>I smiled and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now there is a question
about who her escort was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; said Dumergue.
&ldquo;It is believed that the baron
entertains an extraordinary idea
that the gentleman in question
was no other than&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myself,&rdquo; said the prince,
throwing away his cigarette.</p>

<p>I remembered the baron&rsquo;s
strange questions before the duel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dispose of me as you please,
sir,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you were at the ball,
and knocked the baron down!&rdquo;
exclaimed Dumergue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks,&rdquo; said the
prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are we to do with
him now, sir?&rdquo; asked Dumergue.
&ldquo;The princess will be expecting
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go and tell the princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of Mr. Jason&rsquo;s confession. You
go with Mr. Jason, and tell the
baron that the princess cannot
receive him. I want him to see
Mr. Jason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
fight under my own name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince was already gone,
and Dumergue was halfway down
the stairs. I followed the latter.</p>

<p>We found the baron in the
smoking room, taking a cup of
coffee. A couple of men sat
talking on a settee near him;
otherwise the room was empty.</p>

<p>Dumergue went up to the baron,
I following a step or two behind
him. The baron rose and bowed
coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am charged,&rdquo; said Dumergue,
&ldquo;to express His Royal
Highness&rsquo; regrets that Her Royal
Highness cannot have the pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of receiving you. She has retired
to her apartments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The servant told me she was
at supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was misinformed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to be put off like that.
I&rsquo;ll have a refusal from the princess
herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will inform His Royal Highness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The baron was about to answer,
when he caught sight of me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s the jackal!&rdquo; he
said, with a sneer.</p>

<p>I stepped forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you refer to me?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless I am wrong in recognizing
my former antagonist,
Colonel Despard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was just what I had anticipated.
Dumergue did not seem
surprised either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is Colonel Despard,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
he said. &ldquo;You would not
be likely to forget him, baron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had been speaking in a low
tone, but at Dumergue&rsquo;s sneer, the
baron lost his temper. Raising his
voice, he said, almost in a shout:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I tell Colonel Despard
that he is a mean hound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I assumed the colonel&rsquo;s name,
I felt I must at least defend it
from imputations. I began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once before, baron, I chastised&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was interrupted. One of the
men on the settee interposed, rising
as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, gentlemen, but
is it Colonel Despard of the
Hussars to whom you refer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the baron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that gentleman is not
Colonel Despard,&rdquo; announced our
new friend. &ldquo;I am Colonel Despard&rsquo;s
brother-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment I was at a loss;
things were falling out so very
unfortunately. Dumergue turned
on the stranger fiercely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, sir, was your interposition
solicited?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. But if this
gentleman says he is Colonel Despard,
I take leave to contradict
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should advise you to do
nothing of the sort,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;M.
Dumergue knows me very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This person,&rdquo; said the baron,
&ldquo;passed himself off as Colonel
Despard, and, by that pretext,
obtained from me the honor of a
duel with me. It appears that he
is a mere impostor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other man on the settee
called out cheerfully, &ldquo;Bob, send
for the police!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dumergue looked rather sheepish;
his invention failed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do either or both of these
gentlemen,&rdquo; said I, indicating the
baron and the colonel&rsquo;s brother-in-law,
&ldquo;call me an impostor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the baron, with a
sneering laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am compelled to assert it,&rdquo;
said the other, with a bow.</p>

<p>I had edged near the little table,
on which the baron&rsquo;s coffee had
been served. I now took up the
coffee-pot and milk-jug. The
coffee I threw in the baron&rsquo;s face,
and the milk in that of his ally.
Both men sprang forward with an
oath. At the same moment, the
electric light went out, and I was
violently pulled back toward the
door, and someone whispered,
&ldquo;Vanish as quick as you can.
Go home&mdash;go anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; said I, for I
recognized the prince&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;But what are they doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind; be off.&rdquo; And
the prince handed me a hat.</p>

<p>I walked quickly to the door,
and hailed a hansom. As I drove
off, I saw the prince skip upstairs,
and a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse</i> of waiters rush toward
the smoking room. I went home
to bed.</p>

<p>The next morning, as I was
breakfasting, my man told me two
gentlemen were below, and wished
to see me. I told him to show
them up, and the prince and
Dumergue came in, the former
wrapped up in a fur coat, with a
collar that hid most of his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prince would like some
brandy in a little soda water,&rdquo; said
Dumergue.</p>

<p>I administered the cordial.
The prince drank it, and then
turned to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get home all right?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you took leave of us,
we had an explanation. Mr.
Wetherington&mdash;it was Mr. Wetherington
at whom you threw the
milk&mdash;was very reasonable. I
explained the whole matter, and
he said he was sure his brother-in-law
would pardon the liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I took rather a
liberty with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Dumergue, &ldquo;we
made him believe the milk was
meant for the baron, as well as
the coffee. I said we took it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au
lait</i> at Glottenberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky I thought of turning
out the light,&rdquo; said the prince.
&ldquo;I was looking on, and it seemed
about time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did the hotel people
say, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are going to sue the
electric company,&rdquo; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
prince, with a slight smile. &ldquo;It
seems there is a penalty if the
light doesn&rsquo;t work properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the baron, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We kicked the baron out as
a blackmailer,&rdquo; said Dumergue.
&ldquo;He is going to bring an action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I return to Glottenberg to-day,&rdquo;
concluded the prince; &ldquo;accompanied
by the princess and
M. Dumergue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought this course very
prudent, and said so. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I
added, &ldquo;I shall be called as a
witness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; Colonel Despard will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will establish an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alibi</i>.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà tout!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad it all ends so happily, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there is one matter,&rdquo;
said the prince. &ldquo;I had to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the princess of your indiscretion
in taking Mme. Vooght&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jason,&rdquo; put in Dumergue,
&ldquo;has not heard that the countess
and Vooght are married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;they
are married, and will settle in
America. Vooght is a loss; but
we can&rsquo;t have everything in this
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Herr Vooght will be
happy,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think it very unlikely,&rdquo;
said the prince. &ldquo;But,
to return. The princess is very
angry with you. She insists&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I should never be presented
to her again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary; that you
should come and apologize in
person. Only on condition of
bringing you again could I make
my peace for bringing you once.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>I was very much surprised, but
of course I said I was at the princess&rsquo;
commands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind meeting us in
Paris? We stay there a few
days,&rdquo; said Dumergue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; added the prince,
&ldquo;Dumergue says there are things
called writs, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be in Paris to-morrow,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be there to-day,&rdquo; said
the prince, rising.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="f9">The Mission of the Ruby</span></h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_i.png" width="71" height="71" alt="I" title="I" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">I could</span> not imagine
why the princess desired
to see me. It would
have been much more natural to
punish the impertinence of which
I had no doubt been guilty&mdash;I
mean, of which it was agreed on
all hands that I had been guilty&mdash;by
merely declining to receive me
or see me again. Even the desire
for a written apology would
have been treating me as of too
much account. But she wanted
to see me. What I had heard of
the princess&rsquo; character utterly forbade
any idea which ought not to
have been, but would have been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
pleasant to entertain. No; she
clearly wanted me, but what for I
could not imagine.</p>

<p>When I went to claim my audience,
the prince was not visible,
nor Dumergue either, and I was
at once received by the princess
alone. She was looking smaller,
and more simple and helpless than
ever. I also thought her looking
prettier, and I enjoyed immensely
the pious, severe, forgiving little
rebuke which she administered to
me. I humbly craved pardon,
and had no difficulty in obtaining
it. Indeed, she became very gracious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must come to Glottenberg,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;in a few months&rsquo;
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To obey Your Royal Highness&rsquo;
commands will be a delightful
duty,&rdquo; said I, bowing.</p>

<p>She rose and stood by the fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
&ldquo;toying&rdquo; (as the novelists say)
with her fan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to be an obliging
man, Mr. Jason,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
were ready to oblige Mme.
Vooght.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made a gesture of half-serious
protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;if
you would do me a little service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be most honored if I
may hope to be able to,&rdquo; said I.
What did she want?</p>

<p>She blushed slightly, and, with
a nervous laugh, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a short story. When
I was a young girl, I was foolish
enough, Mr. Jason, to fall in love,
or at least to think I did. There
was a young English <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attaché</i>&mdash;I
know I can rely on your perfect
discretion&mdash;at my father&rsquo;s court,
and he&mdash;he forgot the difference
between us. He was a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
rank, though. Well, I was foolish
enough to accept from him a very
valuable ring&mdash;a fine ruby&mdash;quite
a family heirloom. Of course, I
never wore it, but I took it. And
when I married, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness had no
opportunity of returning it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. He had left the
court. I didn&rsquo;t know where he
was, and&mdash;and the post was not
quite trustworthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw in the papers the other
day that he was married. Of
course I can&rsquo;t keep it. His wife
ought to have it&mdash;and I dare not&mdash;I
would prefer not to&mdash;send
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. You would wish
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be my messenger. Will
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course I assented. She
went into an adjoining room, and
returned with a little morocco
case. Opening it, she showed me
a magnificent ruby, set in an old
gold ring of great beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you give it him?&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness has not
told me his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Daynesborough. You
will be able to find him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will&mdash;you <em>will</em> be
careful, Mr. Jason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall have it safely in
three days. Any message with
it, madame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Yes&mdash;just my best wishes
for his happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed and prepared to withdraw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you must come and tell
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will come and make my
report.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know how to thank
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I kissed her hand and bowed
myself out, mightily amused, and,
maybe, rather touched at the revelation
of this youthful romance.
Somehow such things are always
touching, stupid as they are for the
most part. It pleased me to find
that the little princess was flesh
and blood.</p>

<p>She followed me to the door,
and whispered, as I opened it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not troubled the prince
with the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wives are so considerate,&rdquo;
thought I, as I went downstairs.</p>

<p>On arriving in England, I made
inquiries about Lord Daynesborough.
I found that it was
seven years since he had abruptly
thrown up his post of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attaché</i>, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
cause assigned. After this
event, he lived in retirement for
some time, and then returned into
society. Three months ago he
had married Miss Dorothy Codrington,
a noted beauty, with whom
he appeared much in love, and had
just returned from his wedding
tour and settled down for the season
at his house in Curzon Street.
Hearing all this, I thought the
little princess might have let well
alone, and kept her ring; but her
conduct was no business of mine,
and I set about fulfilling my commission.
I needed no one to tell
me that Lady Daynesborough had
better, as the princess would have
phrased it, not be troubled with
the matter.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in meeting
the young lord. In spite of the
times we live in, a Jason is still a
welcome guest in most houses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
before long he and I were sitting
side by side at Mrs. Closmadene&rsquo;s
table. The ladies had withdrawn,
and we were about to follow them
upstairs. Daynesborough was a
frank, pleasant fellow, and scorned
the affectation of concealing his
happiness in the married state. In
fact, he seemed to take a fancy to
me, and told me that he would like
me to come and see him at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will
cease to distrust marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be most glad to come,&rdquo;
I answered, &ldquo;more especially as I
want a talk with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you? About what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a message for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a message for me,
Mr. Jason? Forgive me, but from
whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I leaned over toward him, and
whispered, &ldquo;The Princess Ferdinand
of Glottenberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The man turned as white as a
sheet, and, gripping my hand, said
under his breath:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! Surely you&mdash;you
haven&rsquo;t&mdash;she hasn&rsquo;t sent it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God! After seven
years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>General Closmadene rose from
his chair. Daynesborough drank
off a very large &ldquo;white-wash,&rdquo; and
added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to dinner to-morrow&mdash;eight
o&rsquo;clock. We shall be alone;
and, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, say
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said nothing, and I went to
dinner, carrying the ruby ring in
my breast-pocket. But I began
to wonder whether the little princess
was quite as childlike as she
seemed.</p>

<p>Lady Daynesborough dined with
us. She was a tall, slender girl;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
very handsome, and, to judge
from her appearance, not wanting
in resolution and character. She
was obviously devoted to her husband,
and he treated her with an
affectionate deference that seemed
to me almost overdone. It was
like the manner of a man who is
remorseful for having wounded
someone he loves.</p>

<p>When she left us, he returned
to the table, and, with a weary
sigh, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Jason, I am ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My task is a very short one,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;I have no message except
to convey to you the princess&rsquo;
best wishes for your happiness on
your marriage, of which she has
recently heard, and to give you
the ring. Here it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have women no mercy?&rdquo;
groaned he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; said I,
rather startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She waits seven years&mdash;seven
years without a word or a sign&mdash;and
then sends it! And why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Isn&rsquo;t it&mdash;devilish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. It&rsquo;s strictly correct.
She said herself that your
wife was the proper person to have
the ring now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me with a bitter
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Jason,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
have been flattering your acumen
at the expense of your morality.
I thought you knew what this
meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more than what the princess
told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, or you
would not have brought it. When
we parted, I gave her the ring,
and she made me promise, on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
honor as a gentleman, to come to
her the moment she sent the ring&mdash;to
leave everything and come to
her, and take her away. And I
promised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she has never sent till
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never married till now,&rdquo; he
said bitterly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing that I know of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose, went to a writing table,
and came back with a fat paper
book&mdash;a Continental Bradshaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going?&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I promised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You promised something to
your wife too, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t argue it. I must go
and see what she wants. I&mdash;I
hope she&rsquo;ll let me come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to dissuade him. I know
I told him he was a fool; I think I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
told him he was a scoundrel. I
was not sure of the second, but
I thought it wisest to pretend that
I was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it will be all right,&rdquo; he
said, again and again; &ldquo;but, right
or wrong, I must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took an immediate resolution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll go by the
eleven-o&rsquo;clock train to Paris to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re wrong. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock the next day
I called in Curzon Street, and
sent in my card to Lady Daynesborough.</p>

<p>She saw me at once. I expect
that she fancied I had something
to do with her husband&rsquo;s sudden
departure. She was looking pale
and dispirited, and I rather thought
she had been crying. Her husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
it appeared, had told her
that he had to go to Paris on business,
and would be back in three
days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell you what it
was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Some public affairs, I
understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Daynesborough,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;you hardly know me, but my
name tells you I am a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, Mr. Jason.
But what has that to do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain. But, if you
are wise, you will come with me to
Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go with you to Paris! Oh!
is he in danger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In danger of making a fool of
himself. Now, I&rsquo;ll say nothing
more. Will you come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will look very strange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In fact&mdash;most unusual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t there be a&mdash;a&mdash;scandal,
if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure to be. Will you come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have a reason,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We started that evening, nine
hours after My Lord, going separately
to the station, and meeting
on the boat. All through the
journey she scarcely spoke a word.
When we were nearing Paris, she
asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know where he is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but I can trace him,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>

<p>So I could. I bought a paper,
and found that Prince and Princess
Ferdinand had, the day before,
proceeded from Paris <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for
Glottenberg. Of course Daynesborough
had followed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must go on,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because your husband has
gone on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She obeyed me like a lamb;
but there was a look about her
pretty mouth that made me doubt
if Daynesborough would find her
like a lamb.</p>

<p>We went to the principal hotel
in Glottenberg. I introduced
Lady Daynesborough as my
sister, Miss Jacynth Jason, and
stated that she was in weak
health, and would keep her room
for the present. Then I sallied
forth, intent on discovering Dumergue;
he would be able to
post me up in the state of affairs.</p>

<p>On my way, I met the king taking
his daily drive. He was a
dour, sour-looking, pasty-faced
creature, and I quite understood
that he would fail to appreciate
many of my prince&rsquo;s characteristics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
A priest sat by him, and
a bystander told me it was the
king&rsquo;s confessor (the Glottenberg
family are all of the old church),
and added that the king&rsquo;s confessor
was no mean power in the
state. I asked him where M.
Dumergue was lodged, and he directed
me to Prince Ferdinand&rsquo;s
palace, which stood in a pleasant
park in the suburbs of the town.</p>

<p>I found Dumergue in a melancholy
condition, though he professed
to be much cheered by the
sight of me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;you, if anybody, can get us out
of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew such people,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been a&mdash;an explosion.
Did you ever hear of
Daynesborough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said no, and Dumergue told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
me of the princess&rsquo; former <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</i>
for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s invited him here,
and he&rsquo;s now in the palace. You
may imagine the prince&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose the prince can turn
him out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dumergue shook his head dolefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She holds the trumps,&rdquo; he
answered. &ldquo;Jason, she&rsquo;s a clever
woman. We thought we had
hoodwinked her. When Daynesborough
turned up, looking, I&rsquo;m
bound to say, very sheepish, the
prince was really quite annoyed.
He told the princess that she must
send him away. She refused
flatly. &lsquo;Then I shall consult my
brother,&rsquo; says the prince. &lsquo;I
shall consult the king too,&rsquo; said
the princess. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s indecent,&rsquo; said
he. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not as bad as taking my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
ladies to masked balls in disguise,&rsquo;
she answered. &lsquo;Oh, you think
you imposed on me&mdash;you and
that clumsy young animal (forgive
me, my dear fellow), Jason. I
am not an idiot. I knew all the
time. And now the king will
know too&mdash;unless Lord Daynesborough
stays just as long as I
like.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound her!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;The prince is furious, the princess
triumphant, and Daynesborough
in possession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he mean to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can tell? She&rsquo;s a little
devil. Fancy pretending to be
deceived, and then turning on us
like this! You should have
heard her describe you, my
boy!&rdquo; and Dumergue chuckled
in sad pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>I object to being ridiculed,
especially by women. I determined
to take a hand in the
game. I wondered if they knew
that Daynesborough was married.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose this young Daynesborough
enjoys himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he ought to. He&rsquo;s got
nothing to lose; but he seems
a melancholy, glum creature. I
think he must be one of the king&rsquo;s
kidney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or married, perhaps?&rdquo; I suggested
airily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! She wouldn&rsquo;t have
him here, if he were married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw that Dumergue did not
yet appreciate the princess in
whose household he had the
honor to serve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t compromise herself,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not she!&rdquo; he replied regretfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
&ldquo;She may compromise
the prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I rebuked him for his cynicism,
and promised to consider and let
him know if anything occurred to
me. My hope lay in Daynesborough.
I could see that he
was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galant malgré lui</i>, and I
thought I could persuade him
that he had done all that his mistaken
promise fairly entailed on
him; or, if I could not convince
him, I had a suspicion that his
wife might, could, and would, in
a very peremptory fashion, if I
brought about an encounter between
them. I was full of eagerness,
for, apart from my zeal
in the cause of morality and
domestic happiness, I did not
approve of being called a clumsy
young animal. It was neither
true nor witty; and surely abuse
ought to be one or the other, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
is to be distinguished from mere
vulgar scurrility.</p>

<p>I have been told, by those who
know the place, that Glottenberg
is not, as a rule, a very exciting
residence. But for the next four-and-twenty
hours I, at least, had
no reason to grumble at a lack of
incidents.</p>

<p>The play began, if I may so
express myself, by the princess
sending for the doctor. The
doctor, having heard from the
princess what she wanted to do,
told her what she ought to do;
of course I speak from conjecture.
He prescribed a visit to
her country villa for a week or
two, plenty of fresh air, complete
repose, and freedom from worry.
Dumergue told me that the princess
considered that the terms of
this prescription entailed a temporary
separation from her husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and that the prince had
agreed to remain in Glottenberg.
The princess started for her villa
at twelve o&rsquo;clock on Wednesday
morning. The distance was but
fifteen miles, and she traveled by
road in her own carriage, although
the main line of railway from
Glottenberg to Paris passed within
two miles of her destination.</p>

<p>At one o&rsquo;clock Lord Daynesborough
was received by Prince
Ferdinand, having requested an
interview for the purpose of taking
his leave, as he left for Paris
by the five o&rsquo;clock train. Everybody
knew that the prince and
Daynesborough were not on cordial
terms; but this fact hardly
explained Daynesborough&rsquo;s extreme
embarrassment and obvious
discomfort during the brief
conversation. Dumergue escorted
him from the prince&rsquo;s presence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and said that he was shaking like
an aspen-leaf or an ill-made
blanc-mange.</p>

<p>At three o&rsquo;clock I went to the
hotel, and had an interview with
Lady Daynesborough. I then
returned to the palace, and made
a communication to the prince.
The prince was distinctly perturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought she would go
so far,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that
she cares twopence about Daynesborough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what, then, sir, do you
attribute&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Temper! all temper, Mr.
Jason! She is angry about that
wretched ball, and she wants to
anger me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her Royal Highness is, however,
giving a handle to her
enemies,&rdquo; I ventured to suggest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She must come back to-night,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be made to
look like a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My plan will, I hope, dispose
of Lord Daynesborough. If so,
Your Royal Highness might join
the princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t do anything of the
sort. I shall have her brought
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently there was a reserve
of resolution latent somewhere in
this indolent gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go yourself, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. You must do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, sir? Surely, M. Dumergue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dumergue&rsquo;s afraid of her.
Will you bring her back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supposing she won&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t request you to ask
her to come. I requested you to
bring her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at him inquiringly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
He inhaled a mouthful of smoke,
and added, with a nod:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will Your Royal Highness
hold me harmless from the king&mdash;or
the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I can&rsquo;t. Will you do
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At ten minutes to five, Lady
Daynesborough, heavily veiled,
and I drove up to the station in a
hired cab, and hid ourselves in
the third-class waiting room. At
five minutes to five, Lord Daynesborough
arrived. He wore a scarf
up to his nose, and a cap down to
his eyes, and walked to the station,
unattended and without luggage.
He got into a second-class smoking
carriage&mdash;one of the long
compartments divided into separate
boxes by intervening partitions
reaching within a yard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the roof, a gang-way running
down the middle. On seeing him
enter, I caught the guard, gave
him twenty marks, and told him to
admit no one except myself and
my companion into that carriage.
Then I hauled Lady Daynesborough
in, and we sat down at
the opposite end to that occupied
by her husband.</p>

<p>The train started. It was only
five-and-twenty minutes&rsquo; run to
the station for the princess&rsquo; villa.
There was no time to lose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; I whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, her voice
trembling a little.</p>

<p>We rose, walked along, and sat
down opposite to Lord Daynesborough.
He was looking out of
the window, although it was dark,
and did not turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Daynesborough,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;you have forgotten your ticket.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
And I held out a through ticket
to Paris.</p>

<p>He started as if he had been
shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who the devil&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;Jason!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your
ticket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were in England,&rdquo;
he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spying on my actions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Acquainted with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no interference, sir.
If you know me, you will kindly
be silent, and leave me to myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Time was passing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to Paris with
this lady,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re insolent, sir&mdash;you and
your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say what you&rsquo;ll regret.
She&rsquo;s your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, of course he was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
much in the wrong, and looked
uncommonly ridiculous to boot.
Still, the way he collapsed was
rather craven. I withdrew for
five minutes. Then I returned,
and held out the ticket again. He
took it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will leave us for five
minutes, Lady Daynesborough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went into the next box.
Then I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ve only ten minutes.
We&rsquo;re going to change clothes.
Be quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took off my coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By God, I&rsquo;ll not stand this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he rose.</p>

<p>In a moment I had him by the
collar, and was presenting a pistol
at his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No nonsense!&rdquo; I whispered.
&ldquo;Off with them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He might have known I would
not shoot him in his wife&rsquo;s presence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
but I could and would
have undressed him with my own
hands. Perhaps he guessed this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>I released him, and he took off
his coat.</p>

<p>The train began to slacken
speed. I called to Lady Daynesborough,
who rejoined us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have fulfilled your promise,&rdquo;
said I to the young man.
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; I added, turning to her,
&ldquo;I have fulfilled mine. Good-night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I opened the door, and jumped
out as we entered the station. I
stood waiting till the train started
again, but Lord Daynesborough
remained in his place. I wonder
what passed on that journey. She
was a plucky girl, and I can only
trust she gave him what he deserved.
At any rate, he never, so
far as I heard, ran away again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>I asked my way to the villa,
and reached it after half an hour&rsquo;s
walking. I did not go in by the
lodge gates, but climbed the
palings, and reached the door
by way of the shrubberies. I
knocked softly. A man opened
the door instantly. He must have
been waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it Milord?&rdquo; he said in
French.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, entering
rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are expected, Milord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not know his voice, and
it was dark in the passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am wet,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Take me
to a fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one in the pantry,&rdquo;
he answered, leading the
way.</p>

<p>We reached the pantry, and he
turned to light the gas.</p>

<p>Looking at me in the full blaze,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
he started back, then scrutinized
me closely, then exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? You are not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I am! I am Lord
Daynesborough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie. You are a robber&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Lord Daynesborough&mdash;Lord
Daynesborough&mdash;Lord
Daynesborough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At each repetition I advanced
a step nearer; at the last I produced
my trusty pistol, at the same
time holding out a bank-note in
the other hand.</p>

<p>He took the note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will stay here,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;for the next two hours. You
will not come out, whatever happens.
Is there anyone else in the
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One maid, Milord, and a man
in the stables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the maid?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the man within hearing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Is the princess upstairs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is, Milord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made him direct me to the
room, and left him. I thought I
would neglect the maid, and go
straight to work. I went up to
the door to which I had been
directed, and knocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said the gentle,
childlike voice.</p>

<p>I went in. The princess was
lying on a sofa by the fire, reading
a paper-covered book. She turned
her head with a careless glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you have come! Well, I
almost hoped you would be afraid.
I really don&rsquo;t want you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This reception would probably
have annoyed Lord Daynesborough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I be afraid?&rdquo;
I asked, mimicking Daynesborough&rsquo;s
voice as well as I could.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I quietly locked the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, because of your wife. I
know you tremble before her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I advanced to the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no wife,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and,
seeing what I do, I thank God
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leaped up with a scream,
loud and shrill.</p>

<p>A door opposite me opened, and
a girl rushing in, crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Go
back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused, looking bewildered.
I walked quickly up to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back and keep quiet;&rdquo;
and, taking her by the shoulders,
I pushed her back into the next
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#frontispiece" title="go to frontispiece">The princess rushed to the other
door, and, on finding it locked,
screamed again.</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;should
embark on these things who has
not good nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She recognized me now. Her
fright had been purely physical&mdash;I
suppose she thought I was a
burglar. When she knew me, she
came forward in a dignified way,
sat down on the sofa, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explain your conduct, sir,
if you are in a condition to do
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sober, madame,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;and I have two messages for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You present yourself in a
strange way. Pray be brief,&rdquo; and
she glanced anxiously at the
clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time does not press, madame,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;Nobody will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody will&mdash;&mdash; What do
you mean? I expect nobody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely, madame&mdash;and nobody
will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her ivory fan broke between
her fingers with a sharp click.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To deliver my messages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, Lord Daynesborough
offers his apologies for being
compelled to leave for Paris without
tendering his farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned very red, and then
very white. But she restrained
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Royal Highness requests
that you will avail yourself of my
escort for an immediate return to
Glottenberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his reasons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, madame, as if I should
inquire them!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are merely insolent, sir.
I shall not go to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Royal Highness was very
urgent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at me for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why had Lord Daynesborough
to leave so suddenly?&rdquo; she
asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His wife wished it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she know where he was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apparently. She followed
him to Glottenberg. She arrived
there yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I see&mdash;now I understand!
I had to deal with a
traitor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must bestow trust, if you
desire not to be deceived, madame.
You dared to use me as
a go-between.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had had practice in the
trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The princess had a turn for
repartee. I could not have set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
her right without quite an argument.
I evaded the point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet Your Royal Highness
thought me a clumsy animal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, with a slight
laugh, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s wounded <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour propre</i>,
is it? Come, Mr. Jason, I apologize.
You are all that is brilliant
and delightful&mdash;and English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness is too
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Mr. Jason, your
device being accomplished, I
suppose I may bid you good-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret, madame, that I must
press the prince&rsquo;s request on your
notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sighed her usual impatient,
petulant little sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are tiresome! Pray
go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot go without you,
madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not going&mdash;and my
establishment does not admit of
my entertaining gentlemen,&rdquo; she
said, with smiling effrontery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness refuses
to allow me to attend you to
Glottenberg?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I order you to leave this
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finally refuses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must add that I am
commissioned, if necessary, to
convey your Royal Highness to
Glottenberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To convey me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dare to threaten me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I follow my instructions.
Will you come, madame, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be taken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not surprised at her vexation.
Dumergue had, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
haste, called her &ldquo;a little devil.&rdquo;
She looked it then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; she asked slowly,
&ldquo;that you will use force?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I yield,&rdquo; she said, after
a pause.</p>

<p>I called the maid, and told her
to order the carriage in five
minutes. The silence was unbroken
till it came round. The
princess went into her room, and
returned in cloak and hat, carrying
a large muff. She was
smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Jason, what can a
woman do, against men? I am
ready. We will go alone. The
servants can follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I handed her into the coach,
ordering the coachman to drive
fast. He was the only man with
us, and we were alone inside.</p>

<p>I began, perhaps stupidly, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
apologize for my peremptory
conduct. The princess smiled
amiably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like a man of resolution,&rdquo;
she said, edging, I thought, a
trifle nearer me, her hands nestling
in her muff.</p>

<p>Apparently she was going to
try the effect of amiability. I
was prepared for this. She would
not tempt me in that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness is most
forgiving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is my way,&rdquo; she answered,
with the kindest possible
glance, and she came nearer still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a most generous
foe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned to me with a dazzling
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say <em>foe</em>,&rdquo; she said, with
a pretty lingering on the last
word. And as she said it, I felt a
knife driven hard into my ribs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and the muff dropped to the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God in heaven!&rdquo; I cried.</p>

<p>The princess flung herself into
the corner of the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha! Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!&rdquo;
she laughed, merrily, musically,
fiendishly.</p>

<p>I tried to clutch her; I believe I
should have killed her, I was half
mad. But the blood was oozing
fast from the wound&mdash;only the
knife itself held my life in.
Things danced before my eyes,
and my hands fell on my
lap.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped, the door
opened, and the coachman appeared.
It was all like a dream
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take his feet,&rdquo; said the princess.
The man obeyed, and between
them they lifted, or, rather,
hauled and pushed, me out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
carriage, and laid me by the roadside.
I was almost in a faint, and
the last thing I was conscious of
was a pretty, mocking mouth,
which said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you escort me, Mr.
Jason?&rdquo;&mdash;and then added to the
coachman, &ldquo;To Glottenberg&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not die. I was picked
up by some good folk, and
well tended. Dumergue arrived
and looked after me, and in a
couple of weeks I was on my
legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for Glottenberg!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>Dumergue shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be admitted to the
town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not admitted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. They have made it up&mdash;for
the time. There must be no
scandal. Come, Jason; surely
you see that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She tried to murder me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite, quite!&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t prosecute her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am to be turned adrift
by the prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What use would it be to return?
No doubt you annoyed
her very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you had undertaken
the job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know her. I should have
ridden outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, then, the prince&rsquo;s wish
that I should not return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But he charges me to
say that he will never forget your
friendly services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was disgusted. But I would
force myself on no man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be much best,&rdquo; he
answered, with revolting alacrity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Dumergue, what does
the princess say about me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She laughs every time your
name is mentioned, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil take her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says you may keep the
knife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have it still, a little tortoise-shell-handled
thing, with a
sharp&mdash;a very sharp&mdash;point. On
the blade is engraved, in German
letters, &ldquo;Sophia.&rdquo; It is a pretty
toy, and in its delicacy, its tininess,
its elegance, its seeming
harmlessness, and its very sharp
point, it reminds me much of
Princess Ferdinand of Glottenberg.</p>

<h2>A MALAPROPOS PARENT.</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_y.png" width="71" height="72" alt="Y" title="Y" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Young</span> Mr. Pippitt had
a father somewhere in
America. Everyone who
knew young Mr. Pippitt knew that;
for he had often spoken of his
father, of the fortune he was making,
and of the liberal presents he
sent home. Then came a time
when young Mr. Pippitt said less
about his father and less about the
presents. Thus it was that people
had almost forgotten the existence
of old Mr. Pippitt, when it was recalled
to their memories in a very
startling and tragical way. Old
Mr. Pippitt had landed in England
and was on his way to London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
when he was killed in a great
railway disaster. His name,
discovered from a letter in his
pocket, was published; and young
Mr. Pippitt flew to the scene.
The body was not mangled or
disfigured, and after one moment
of extreme agitation the bereaved
son informed the official who had
led him to where the dead man
lay that it was indeed his father.
His evidence before the coroner
put the matter beyond doubt.
Mr. Pippitt buried his father, assumed
deep mourning, and wrote
to the company&rsquo;s solicitors. Repugnant
as it was to him to appear
to make money out of the
unhappy occurrence, the loss of
a rich and liberal parent was a
matter which no struggling young
man could, in justice to himself,
submit to without compensation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Railway companies, having an
extensive experience of humanity,
are prone to skepticism; and very
many inquiries were made as to the
life, doings, profession, and profits
of old Mr. Pippitt, and especially
as to his alleged remittances to
his son. That gentleman stood
the fire of questions very successfully;
he had letters from his
father up to within six months of
the accident, and he proved the
receipt of very considerable yearly
sums, in each of the four years
during which his father had been
absent. In face of this evidence,
the matter in issue reduced itself
to a difference of opinion between
the company and young Mr. Pippitt:
first, as to the probability
of old Mr. Pippitt continuing to
make money; secondly, as to the
probability of his continuing to
share what he made with his son.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
More concretely still, the company,
without prejudice, offered two
thousand pounds, and Mr. Pippitt,
without prejudice, asked seven
thousand; whereupon the case
was entered for trial.</p>

<p>Mr. Naylor, the company&rsquo;s
counsel, declared that young Mr.
Pippitt was one of the best witnesses
he had ever seen. His
demeanor was excellent, his facts
irrefragable, his memory neither
unnaturally bad nor suspiciously
good. The last letter he produced
from his father inclosed a
draft for three hundred pounds,
and announced the writer&rsquo;s return
on a business visit by the next
mail but one. By that mail, a
gentleman of the name of Pippitt
had crossed the ocean, and had,
presumably, taken the train on
landing, and met his death in the
accident. Mr. Naylor felt his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
case was so bad that he almost
charged young Mr. Pippitt with
direct perjury, and twisted up a
note to Mr. Budge, who was on
the other side, offering four thousand
pounds and costs. Mr.
Budge answered that he must consult
his client, and that he would
wait till the end of the plaintiff&rsquo;s
evidence. Mr. Naylor nodded,
and redoubled his insinuations of
an unscrupulous conspiracy.</p>

<p>Mr. Budge rose to re-examine
with a smile on his face. Mr.
Pippitt said he had no reason to
anticipate a falling-off in his
father&rsquo;s business; it was well
established: nor in his father&rsquo;s
liberality; his father had always
led him to suppose that he would
provide for him. Yes, there was
a strong&mdash;yes, a very strong,
affection between them. Here
Mr. Pippitt&rsquo;s voice faltered; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
judge nodded sympathetically;
and the foreman of the jury
wrote &ldquo;£5,000?&rdquo; on a slip of
paper and passed it round the
box.</p>

<p>That artistic falter produced
another effect also. The gangways
of the court were crowded
with the usual throng of idle folk,
assembled to hear Mr. Naylor&rsquo;s
cross-examination; and as the
plaintiff bore witness to the bonds
of love which bound him to his
father there came from the recesses
of the crowd a voice, which
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there is! Let me
through! Who&rsquo;s saying my boy
doesn&rsquo;t love his old father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The group of people parted;
and an elderly man came to the
front, advancing in an uncertain,
apologetic manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence! silence!&rdquo; cried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
usher, a world of pained indignation
in his accents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t disturb the court,
sir!&rdquo; thundered the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to speak a word for
Joe. I was passing, and dropped
in, and, seeing Joe, I made bold
to speak. He&rsquo;s been a good son,
has Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge looked appealingly
at counsel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Joe, and who is this
person?&rdquo; And getting no answer,
he turned to the plaintiff.
Young Mr. Pippitt met his eye
with an uneasy smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea, my
lord,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The judge looked at the
writ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your name is Joseph?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&mdash;yes&mdash;that is, certainly,
my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem very sure,
sir,&rdquo; remarked the judge; and he
added, addressing the intruder,
&ldquo;Who are you, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man seemed in a nervous
and broken-down condition;
but he stammered out, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my
son, my son, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; cried young Mr.
Pippitt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue till you&rsquo;re
asked to speak,&rdquo; said his lordship
snappishly. &ldquo;I want to hear what
this man has to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man had much to say:
much of young Mr. Pippitt&rsquo;s virtue,
industry, and much of his own fortunes,
misfortunes, and wrongs.
He usurped the functions of both
lawyer and witness, and all the
court listened to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to be here, gentlemen,&rdquo;
he said&mdash;&ldquo;glad to be here.
I thought I was never going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
get out of that cell they put me in,
not for long years. But here I
am, Joe, thank God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who put you in a cell?&rdquo; asked
the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you as fast as I
can,&rdquo; answered the old man petulantly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just written to Joe
to send him a bit of money and
tell him to look out for me, when
they brought a charge of fraud
against me&mdash;against me, a respectable
merchant. And I was tried:
tried and found guilty&mdash;unjustly,
my lord&mdash;and sentenced to five
years. To think of it! They
didn&rsquo;t know me out in Louisiana;
no east-coast jury would have
convicted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they know you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to have my
name known. I called myself
Brown; and they convicted me&mdash;as
I wrote to you, Joe&mdash;for five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
years. But the Governor did his
duty. He was a white man, the
Governor. He let me out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the judge
curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was a white man to get five
years for besting a nigger?&rdquo;
demanded the old man, with his
first approach to vigor. &ldquo;Not
if the Governor knew it! Oh,
he was a white man. So here
I am, Joe&mdash;here I am, thank
God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge leaned forward and
asked, &ldquo;Have you any letters
from the man you say is your
son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man pulled a dirty
letter out of his pocket, and
handed it up with a bewildered
look.</p>

<p>Young Mr. Pippitt still looked
on with his fixed smile, while the
judge read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad job that you&rsquo;re
nabbed. Five years is no joke.
Why were you such a fool? You
were right about the name. Keep
it quite dark, for God&rsquo;s sake!
I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Yours,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;J.&nbsp;P.</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;Received your last all right.&rdquo;<br /></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Is that your handwriting?&rdquo;
the judge asked of the plaintiff;
but young Mr. Pippitt swayed to
and fro and fell in a faint in the
witness-box. The judge turned
to Mr. Budge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you desire,&rdquo; he asked,
&ldquo;that this man should be sworn,
and repeat his evidence on oath,
so that you may cross-examine
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Budge looked at his inanimate
client, and answered, &ldquo;I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
not, my lord. I shall probably
have your lordship&rsquo;s approval in
withdrawing from the case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the judge directed the
jury to return a verdict for the
defendant, the old man had
anxiously watched the usher,
who was unloosing young Mr.
Pippitt&rsquo;s neckcloth. When the
plaintiff revived, the old man
leaned over to Mr. Budge, and
said, with a pleased smile, &ldquo;Oh,
he&rsquo;ll be all right directly, won&rsquo;t
he? I thought I could help a bit.
I have helped a bit, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have helped him to
twelve months&rsquo; hard labor,&rdquo; said
Mr. Budge.</p>

<p>But the old man did not understand
what it all meant, till one
day they took him to Kensal
Green, and showed him a handsome
tombstone. The inscription
ran:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">In Memory of James Pippitt.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The old man read and laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of that!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It beats everything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He read on with a chuckle:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Erected by his sorrowing son,
Joseph Pippitt. Born 13th December,
1821. Died 5th February,
1891. &lsquo;I shall go to him,
but he shall not return to me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This prophecy might or might
not be true of the person interred
beneath the tombstone. On its
unfortunate inapplicability to his
father, and on the tainting of the
fountain of Louisiana justice,
young Mr. Pippitt enjoyed twelve
months&rsquo; quiet reflection.</p>

<h2>HOW THEY STOPPED THE
&ldquo;RUN.&rdquo;</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="68" height="70" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was a run on the
Sandhill and District
Bank. It had lasted the
whole of one day, and had shown
no signs of abating in the evening.
If it lasted another day!
Old Mr. Bradshaw wiped his
brow. It had come just at the
awkwardest time&mdash;just after the
farmers had got their usual loans,
just when securities were hard to
realize; in fact, just at the moment
when the bank, though in
reality solvent, was emphatically
not in a position in answer a long-continued
demand for payment on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the spot. Mr. Bradshaw groaned
out all these distressing facts to
his son Dick. It was, indeed, no
use talking to Dick, for he took
no interest in business, and had
spent the day in a boat with the
Flirtington girls; still, Mr. Bradshaw
was bound to talk to someone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall have to put the shutters
up. One day&rsquo;s grace would
save us, I believe; we could get
the money then. But if they&rsquo;re
at us again to-morrow morning,
we can&rsquo;t last two hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick sympathized, but had
nothing to suggest, except that it
would not make matters worse if
he carried out his engagement to
go to the circus with the Flirtington
girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, go to h&mdash;ll with the Flirtington
girls, if you like,&rdquo; groaned
Mr. Bradshaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>So Dick went&mdash;to the circus
(the other expedition, as he observed,
would keep), and enjoyed
the performance very much, especially
the lion-taming, which
was magnificent, and so impressed
Dick that he deserted his companions,
went behind the scenes,
and insisted on standing Signor
Philippini several glasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that big chap quite safe?&rdquo;
he asked admiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> can do anythink with &rsquo;im,&rdquo;
said the signor (whose English
was naturally defective); &ldquo;but
with anyone helse &rsquo;e&rsquo;s a roarer, &rsquo;e
is, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the performance Dick
took the Flirtington girls home;
then, with a thoughtful look on
his face, he went and had some
talk with his father, and came
away, carefully placing a roll of
notes in his breast pocket. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
he sought Signor Philippini&rsquo;s society
once more. And that&rsquo;s all
that is really known about it&mdash;if,
that is, we discard the obviously
fanciful statement of Fanny Flirtington
that, as she was gazing
at the moon about 2 <span class="f8">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, she
saw a heavy wagon, drawn by two
horses and driven by Signor
Philippini, pass along the street in
the direction of the bank. She
must have been wrong; for
Philippini, by the evidence of his
signora (whose name, notwithstanding
that Philippini&rsquo;s morals
were perfectly correct, was Mrs.
Buggins), went to bed at 11.30,
and snored like a pig all night.</p>

<p>However these things may be,
this is what happened next morning.
When the first of the depositors
arrived at 7 <span class="f8">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, they
found one of the windows of
the bank smashed to pieces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the shutter hanging loose. A cry
went up that there had been a
robbery, and one or two men began
to climb in. They did not
get far before a fearful roar proceeded
from the neighborhood
of the counter. They looked at
one another, and said it would be
more regular to wait for the
officials. The roars continued.
They sent for Mr. Bradshaw.
Hardly had he arrived (accompanied
by Dick, breathless and in
shirt-sleeves) before the backmost
rows of the now considerable
crowd became agitated with a new
sensation. The news spread
rapidly. Frantic men ran to and
fro; several ladies fainted; the
circus-proprietor was sent for. A
lion had escaped from the menagerie,
and was supposed to be at
large in the town!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send for Philippini!&rdquo; cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the proprietor. They did so.
Philippini had started early for a
picnic in the country, and would
not return till just before the performance
in the evening. The
proprietor was in despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the beast gone to?&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p>A roar from the bank answered
his question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed if he&rsquo;s not
in the bank!&rdquo; exclaimed the proprietor.</p>

<p>It certainly appeared to be the
fact that Atlas (that was the
lion&rsquo;s name) had taken refuge in
the bank, and was in full possession
of the premises and assets.
Under these circumstances there
was, Mr. Bradshaw explained, a
difficulty in resuming cash payments;
but if his checks would be
accepted&mdash;&mdash; The crowd roared
almost as loud as Atlas at such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
idea. Something must be done.
They sent for the mayor; he
repudiated liability. They sent
for the fire brigade and the lifeboat
crew; neither would come.
They got guns, and peppered the
furniture. Atlas retired behind
the fireproof safe and roared
worse than ever. Meanwhile the
precious hours were passing.
Mr. Bradshaw&rsquo;s money was also
on its way from London. At
last Dick took a noble resolution.</p>


<p>&ldquo;I will go in at any cost,&rdquo; he
cried, and, in spite of Fanny
Flirtington&rsquo;s tears, he scaled the
window and disappeared from
view. The crowd waited to hear
Atlas scrunching; but he only
roared. When Dick was inside,
he paused and asked in a low
voice: &ldquo;Is he chained?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Signor Philippini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
from behind the safe. &ldquo;Is
the Aunt Sally business over?&rdquo;
and he came out with a long pole
in his hand. He used the pole to
stir poor Atlas up when the roars
became deficient in quantity and
quality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The money ought to be here
in three hours,&rdquo; said Dick.
&ldquo;Have you got the back-door
key?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philippini reassured him. Then
Dick took a wild running leap at
the window; Philippini stirred up
Atlas, who roared lustily. Dick
escaped with his life, and landed,
a breathless heap, at the mayor&rsquo;s
feet. The mayor raised him, and
said he should write to Her
Majesty, and suggest that Dick
would be a proper recipient of
the Albert Medal, and the vicar
(who had no money in the bank)
indignantly asked the crowd if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
they could not trust a family
which produced scions like that.
Several people cried &ldquo;Hear,
hear!&rdquo; and told Mr. Bradshaw
that they never really meant to
withdraw their deposits. Mr.
Bradshaw thanked them, and
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>At half-past three Philippini
ran up; he also was breathless,
and his shoes were dusty from
walking in the country. At once
he effected an entry, amid a scene
of great excitement. A moment
later he appeared at the window
and cried in a terror-stricken
voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;old &rsquo;im! I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;old
&rsquo;im! &rsquo;E&rsquo;s mad! Look out for
yourselves!&rdquo; and he leaped from
the window.</p>

<p>The crowd fled in all directions,
and two boys were all but run
over by a cart which was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
driven rapidly from the railway
station to the bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Dick to the
signor; &ldquo;bring up the wagon.&rdquo;
And then, with great difficulty and
consummate courage, the signor
and Dick brought an iron cage up
to the window, and drove Atlas
in. The operation took more than
an hour, because they had to feed
Atlas and drink a bottle of champagne
themselves before they set
about it. So that it was six o&rsquo;clock
before Atlas was out, and the
money was in, and the Sandhill
and District Bank opened its doors
for business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We gained just the time we
needed,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradshaw.
&ldquo;It was dirt-cheap at fifty
pounds!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Dick, although he did not
get the Albert Medal, was taken
into partnership, and married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Fanny Flirtington. It was the
only way of preventing her seeing
things she was not meant to see
out of the window at 2 <span class="f8">A.&nbsp;M.</span> and
chattering about them in public.</p>

<h2>A LITTLE JOKE.</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_a.png" width="71" height="71" alt="A" title="A" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">A day</span> or two before Easter,
I was sitting in my
office, finishing up some
scraps of work, and ever and anon
casting happy glances at my portmanteau,
which stood in the corner.
I was just off to spend a
fortnight with my old friend Colonel
Gunton, in Norfolk, and I
was looking forward to seeing
him again with great pleasure.
We had not met for ten years,
and I had never been to his place
or seen any of his family. It
would be delightful.</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, confound it! I hope
that&rsquo;s nothing to keep me!&rdquo; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
exclaimed; and I rose to see
to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Miller? Are you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll come round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes passed, and then
my clerk announced, &ldquo;A lady to
see you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A remarkably pretty girl of
about eighteen was ushered in.
She stood still some way from me
till the door was closed. Then
she suddenly rushed toward me,
fell at my feet, and exclaimed,
&ldquo;You will protect me, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady, what in
the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the famous Mr. Miller,
aren&rsquo;t you? Mr. Joseph Miller,
the philanthropist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Joseph Miller
certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Then I am safe;&rdquo; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
she sat down in an armchair, and
smiled confidingly at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said I sternly,
&ldquo;will you have the goodness to
explain to what I owe the pleasure
of this visit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They told me to come to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the people at the police
station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The police station?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, when they let me go&mdash;because
it was a first offense, you
know. They said you always took
up cases like mine, and that if I
stuck to you I should be well
looked after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quite true that I have
taken an interest in rescuing
young persons from becoming
habitual criminals; but I was
hardly prepared for this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing this time&mdash;only a
bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t know me up
here,&rdquo; she explained smilingly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always practiced in the
country. Wasn&rsquo;t it lucky? But
really, Mr. Miller, I&rsquo;m tired of it;
I am indeed. The life is too exciting:
the doctors say so; so
I&rsquo;ve come to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The case was a strange one,
but I had no time to investigate it
now. It wanted only half an hour
to the time my train left Liverpool
Street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sarah Jones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will have your case
looked into. Come and see me
again; or, if you are in distress,
you may write to me&mdash;at Colonel
Gunton&rsquo;s, Beech Hill, Norfolk.
I shall be staying there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Going now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I start in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll come with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; I answered, with
emphasis, &ldquo;I will see you&mdash;out of
the office first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what am I to do? Oh,
it&rsquo;s nonsense! I shall come. I
shall say I belong to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I rang the bell. &ldquo;Show this
lady out, Thomas, at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed, bowed, and went.
Evidently a most impudent hussy.
I finished my business, drove to
Liverpool Street, and established
myself in a first-class smoking carriage.
I was alone, and settled
myself for a comfortable cigar. I
was rudely interrupted. Just as
the train was starting, the door
opened&mdash;and that odious young
woman jumped in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! I nearly missed
you!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can hold no communication
with you,&rdquo; said I severely; &ldquo;you
are a disgrace to your&mdash;er&mdash;sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ve wired to
the colonel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve wired to my friend
Colonel Gunton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I didn&rsquo;t want to surprise
them. I said you would bring a
friend with you. It&rsquo;s all right,
Mr. Miller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are or
what you are; but the Guntons
are respectable people, and I am a
respectable man, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no reason why you
should promenade up and down,
Mr. Miller. It&rsquo;s very uncomfortable
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this
insolent behavior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not be friendly? We&rsquo;re
off now, and I must go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall give you in charge at
the next station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On reflection, I supposed she
had committed no criminal
offense; and with a dignified air
I opened my paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind you smoking,&rdquo;
she said, and took out a box of
chocolates.</p>

<p>I was at my wits&rsquo; end. Either
this girl was mad or she was a
dangerous and unscrupulous person.
She was quite capable of
making a most unpleasant and discreditable
commotion on the platform
at Beach Hill Station. What
in the world was I to do?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we stay long at the Guntons&rsquo;?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, madam, will never go
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed you won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
care of that. The police will see
to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a fig for the
police. I shall go and stay as
long as you do. They told me to
stick to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I became angry. Any man
would have. But nothing was to
be gained by losing my temper. I
took out a sovereign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll get out at the next
station, I&rsquo;ll give you this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed merrily. &ldquo;I
thought you went in for personal
supervision, not mere pecuniary
doles,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I read that in
your speech at the Charity Organization
meeting. No; I&rsquo;m not to
be bribed. I&rsquo;m going to the
Guntons&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd. It&rsquo;s preposterous.
What will&mdash;what will Mrs.
Gunton say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>she</em> won&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
my companion, with a confident
nod. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s used to girls like
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You surprise me,&rdquo; I retorted
sarcastically; but she only laughed
again. I returned to my paper.</p>

<p>An hour passed in silence. The
train began to slacken speed as we
neared the station next before
Beech Hill. She looked up and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you really rather I
didn&rsquo;t come with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had passed a wretched hour.
This girl was evidently bent on
blasting my character.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll
get out at this station, I&rsquo;ll give
you a five-pound note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? I heard you never
gave away a farthing! They said
no one could get a penny out of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true that I disapprove of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
indiscriminate charity; but, under
the circumstances, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think I am a deserving
object? Well, I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief, I took a
note from my pocket-book, and
gave it her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay it back soon,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never let me see your face
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apologize for me to the Guntons.
Good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She jumped out lightly, and I
sank back, murmuring, &ldquo;Thank
Heaven!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After I got rid of her my journey
was peaceful and happy, and
I forgot my troubles in the warm
greeting my old friend Bob Gunton
and his wife gave me. The
girl must have lied about the telegram;
at least, Bob made no
reference to it. He had a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
family of boys and girls, and presented
them to me with natural
pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my lot&mdash;except Addie.
She&rsquo;s gone to see some friends;
but we expect her back every
minute. They keep me alive, I
can tell you, Miller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After tea, my host and hostess
insisted on taking me for a stroll
on the terrace. It was a beautiful
evening, and I did not mind the
cold. As we were talking together,
I heard the rumble of
wheels. An omnibus stopped at
the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the &rsquo;bus,&rdquo; said Gunton;
&ldquo;it runs between here and our
market-town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hardly heard him; for, to my
horror, I saw, descending from the
&rsquo;bus and opening the gate, that
girl!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send her away!&rdquo; I cried;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
&ldquo;send her away! On my honor,
Bob, as a gentleman, I know nothing
about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I solemnly assure Mrs. Gunton
and yourself that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the
man? What&rsquo;s he talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bob, that girl&mdash;that
barefaced girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That girl! Why, that&rsquo;s my
daughter Addie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little minx walked up to me
with a smile, dropped a little courtesy,
and said: &ldquo;I knew, Mr.
Miller, that it wasn&rsquo;t true that you
would refuse to help a really
deserving case. The others said
you would; but I thought better
of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she had the effrontery,
then and there, to tell her parents
all about it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>I think parents are the most
infatuated class of persons in the
community. They laughed, and
Mrs. Gunton said, &ldquo;How clever
of you, Addie! You must forgive
her, Mr. Miller. My dear girls
are so playful!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Playful!</em> And she never returned
the five-pound note!</p>

<h2>A GUARDIAN OF MORALITY.</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_m.png" width="69" height="70" alt="M" title="M" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Miss Tabitha Grey</span>
had not reached the age
of forty-five years without
acquiring an extensive and
unfavorable knowledge of her
sex. Men were wicked; Miss
Grey admitted and deplored the
fact, but it was so much in the
order of nature that she had
almost ceased to cavil at it. But
that women should be wicked!
Here Miss Grey&rsquo;s toleration gave
out. And so many women, especially
young women, and more
especially pretty young women,
were wicked. It was atrocious!
Entertaining this general opinion,
Miss Grey, as a matter of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
held Maggie Lester in the utmost
detestation. The Waterfall Hotel
was, in fact, hardly large enough
to contain, in any comfort, Miss
Grey on the one hand and on
the other Maggie Lester, her
brother Charles, and their friend
and traveling companion. Captain
Petrie. It is true that the
feeling of discomfort was entirely
confined to Miss Grey. The
young people were very civil
to her when any one of them
happened to be next her at
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d&rsquo;hôte</i>, and at other times
thought nothing about her;
but Miss Grey endured agonies
enough for an hotelful of people.
She shuddered at Maggie&rsquo;s striped
waistcoat and white sailor&rsquo;s knot
with its golden pin, at her brown
boots, at her love of long and
hard rides, at her not infrequent
slang; above all, at the terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
hearty and familiar <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camaraderie</i>
on which she thought fit to conduct
her acquaintance with Captain
Petrie. The decorum of
literature forbids that Miss Grey&rsquo;s
inmost suspicions should be put in
writing; it must suffice to say that
they were very dark indeed&mdash;so
dark that all the other ladies, to
whom Miss Grey repeated them,
could not but come to the conclusion
that there must be some truth
in them.</p>

<p>One morning, after breakfast,
Miss Grey took her knitting and
the <cite>Church Times</cite> and sat down
in the veranda. A moment later,
to her disgust, Charlie Lester and
Captain Petrie came out of the
breakfast room, lit their pipes,
and, after a polite &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo;
took their seats a few yards
from her. Miss Grey sniffed the
tobacco-tainted air, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
about to rise and ostentatiously
remove herself from the infected
zone, when she heard a scrap of
conversation between the two
young men which entirely altered
her determination. She sat still
and listened with all her might.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder when Maggie will
be down,&rdquo; said Lester; &ldquo;I want
to tell her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re too late,&rdquo; said
Petrie; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, have you seen her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I knew she&rsquo;d like to
know, so I went outside her door
five minutes ago and shouted
what we&rsquo;d heard, and she came
out directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had she anything on?&rdquo; inquired
Lester, in an interested
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded Captain Petrie;
&ldquo;but that made no difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It would to me,&rdquo; said Lester,
with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to me,&rdquo; said the captain;
&ldquo;but it didn&rsquo;t to her. I reminded
her of it, and she said that it
made no odds&mdash;she wanted to
hear all I knew directly. So we
stood in the passage, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Grey had been gradually
becoming more and more horrified.
She had been prepared for
a good deal, but this was too
much. And the creature&rsquo;s own
brother listened to it! Her knitting
fell from her grasp, and the
needles jangled on the tiled floor.
The captain hastened to pick
them up, interrupting his narrative
for that purpose; but Miss
Grey froze him with an awful
look, and strode into the house.</p>

<p>Miss Grey was a woman who
never allowed herself to be turned
from the path of duty, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
painful that path might be to
others. She soon made up her
mind as to what she must do,
and, having come to a resolution,
she laid the whole matter
before an informal committee of
three irreproachable and austere
matrons, whom she selected from
among her fellow-guests. The
immediate result of their conference
was, that when Maggie
Lester, looking very fresh and
blooming after her morning
gallop, came in to luncheon and
took her place at the table, no
fewer than four elderly ladies
put down their knives and forks,
rose from their chairs, and
solemnly stalked out of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo! what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; said
Charlie Lester.</p>

<p>But nobody knew what was up;
and, to all appearance, Maggie
least of all, for she cheerfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
began her lunch, mere remarking
to the captain, as though in
continuance of a previous conversation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have been so bad
if I&rsquo;d had anything&mdash;even the
least little bit&mdash;on, would it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you ought to have put
your boots on,&rdquo; said the captain,
with a smile.</p>

<p>A fifth lady, sitting by, overheard
these remarks, and when,
after lunch, Miss Grey informed
her of the startling occurrence of
the morning, her testimony completed
the damning chain of evidence.
They made a joke of it!
What could the suggestion of
boots&mdash;only boots&mdash;be, except a
vulgar, shameless jest? The
ladies went in a body to the
proprietor, and intimated that
either they or the Lester party
must forthwith leave the hotel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
The proprietor demanded reasons;
cogent, irrefragable reasons
were supplied by Miss Grey and
the fifth lady&mdash;reasons clothed,
of course, in decorous language,
but unmistakably revealing the infamous
conduct of Maggie Lester.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you, ladies,&rdquo; exclaimed
the proprietor, beads of
perspiration standing on his brow,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the first time such a thing
has ever occurred in my house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be the last,&rdquo; said
Miss Grey firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will act at once,&rdquo; declared
the proprietor. &ldquo;This is a respectable
house, and such proceedings
cannot be tolerated.
Good gracious! It would endanger
my license!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your soul,&rdquo; said Miss
Grey solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, miss?&rdquo;
said the proprietor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>And</em> your soul,&rdquo; repeated
Miss Grey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, to be sure&mdash;of course,
my soul, miss. As it was, I had
a bother about it last year&mdash;my
license, I mean, miss. I&rsquo;ll go to
Mr. Lester at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The proprietor was a nervous,
bashful man, and when he found
himself standing before the
Lesters and Captain Petrie, as
they drank their after-luncheon
coffee, he was much embarrassed.
At last he managed to indicate
that he wished to speak to Mr.
Lester alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense!&rdquo; said Charlie.
&ldquo;Go on. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The proprietor nerved himself
for the effort. After all, if these
people were not ashamed for
themselves, why should he blush
for them? Looking sternly at
Charlie, he began to formulate his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
accusation. He had not got far
before Maggie gave a little shriek
of amazement; and the captain,
jumping up, seized him by the
collar, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, you little
rascal? What&rsquo;s this scandalous
nonsense you&rsquo;ve got hold of?&rdquo;
and the captain shook his host
severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not to be bullied, sir,&rdquo;
said the proprietor stoutly. &ldquo;I
have excellent authority for what
I say, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose authority?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The proprietor vouched Miss
Grey and the fifth lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must look into this,&rdquo; said
the captain.</p>

<p>Maggie, who was blushing
severely, but was not without a
secret tendency to convulsive
laughter, was prevailed upon to
accompany them, and the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
proceeded to the drawing room,
where the Inquisition sat enthroned
on the sofa, Miss Grey
presiding. Miss Grey rose with a
gesture of horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not gone yet?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the captain;
&ldquo;we want to hear your story first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no shame?&rdquo; demanded
Miss Grey of Maggie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
the captain; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have the story
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Grey cast an appealing
glance at the ceiling, and began:
&ldquo;With my own ears I heard it.
Mrs. Britson [Mrs. Britson was
the fifth lady] will confirm what I
say. With my own ears I heard
Captain Petrie relate to Mr. Lester&mdash;to
this person&rsquo;s brother&mdash;that
he had had an interview with
this person when this person was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
entirely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Miss Grey paused
for a moment, gathered her courage,
and added in an awestruck
whisper, &ldquo;disrobed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shudder ran through the
audience. The culprits&rsquo; faces expressed
real or simulated astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I must put it plainly,&rdquo;
pursued Miss Grey&mdash;and at this
several ladies opened their fans
and held them before their faces&mdash;&ldquo;Captain
Petrie said that Miss
Lester&mdash;that person&mdash;had nothing
on, and that when he reminded
her of it she stated that the circumstance
was immaterial. Subsequently,
at luncheon, the young
woman herself admitted the fact
in the hearing of Mrs. Britson.
If that is not enough&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It apparently was enough, for
Charlie Lester threw himself into
an armchair with a wild shriek of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
laughter. Maggie&rsquo;s slight figure
shook convulsively as she hid her
face in her handkerchief, and
Captain Petrie, after a moment&rsquo;s
blank amazement, cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! I&rsquo;ve got it. Oh!
this beats anything!&rdquo; And he
joined in with a loud guffaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the way you treat such
a&mdash;an abominable&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
Miss Grey austerely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop! for Heaven&rsquo;s sake
stop!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be the death of me, you
really will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence followed for a moment,
and the captain, conquering his
mirth, went on: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if
any of you ladies go in for horse-racing.
Probably not; I&rsquo;m sure
Miss Grey doesn&rsquo;t. Well, this
morning I heard that a horse of
mine which is running in a race
to-day had done an exceptionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and quite unexpectedly good
trial&mdash;I mean, had proved a far
faster runner than we had supposed.
In fact, there was little
doubt that he would win the race.
Sometimes, ladies, I am wicked
enough to bet. Occasionally
Charlie Lester is equally wicked.
Now and then Miss Lester yields
to that vice. Well, as you know,
we are far from a telegraph here;
and we were much annoyed,
Charlie and I, that we could not
take advantage of our fresh information
to bet on the horse&mdash;to
put something on, as we say.
Miss Lester regretted also, when
I told her the news, that she had
nothing on&mdash;the horse. Do you
begin to understand, ladies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies glanced at one another
in some confusion. Miss
Grey looked angry and suspicious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And the boots?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To put your boots on a
horse,&rdquo; explained the captain
politely, &ldquo;is a slang expression
for betting your entire available
fortune on his success. Another
expression is to put your
shirt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Miss Grey.</p>

<p>But Miss Grey&rsquo;s sway was
ended. Maggie burst into a
fresh fit of laughter, and, after a
moment&rsquo;s pause the whole company
followed suit. Miss Grey
turned and left the room. The
next day she left the hotel; she
could not face her victorious foes.
Captain Petrie insisted on handing
her into the omnibus, saying
as he did so, &ldquo;Be easy, my dear
madam. In future it shall be my
care to see that Miss Lester has
something on.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>NOT A BAD DEAL.</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="68" height="70" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> little volume of verses
entitled, &ldquo;To Lalage,&rdquo;
made quite a stir in the
literary world. One critic of note
said that it was instinct with classic
grace; another that it was informed
by the true spirit of Hellas;
a third that it had a whiff of Hymettus;
a fourth that it was hardly
suitable for family reading; and
on the strength of all this laudation,
&ldquo;To Lalage&rdquo; was a success,
and several copies were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</i>
sold to complete strangers. Imagine,
then, the bitterness of heart
with which Adrian Pottles, the
gifted author, saw himself compelled
to maintain strict anonymity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and to conceal from a world
thirsting to know him that he was
the &ldquo;A.&nbsp;P.&rdquo; whose initials appeared
in Old English letters on
the title-page. Yet he did not
hesitate; for he knew that if his
uncle, Mr. Thomas Pottles, of
Clapham Common, discovered
that he wrote not only verses,
which was bad, but amatory verses,
which was atrocious, his means of
present livelihood and prospects of
future affluence would vanish into
thin air. For Mr. Pottles was a
man of strict views; and, whether
one regarded this world or the
next, there could be no question
that a bank clerk of Evangelical
connections committed a grave
fault in writing love poems. So
poor Adrian had to make up his
mind to remain unknown, and to
hold his tongue even when he
heard that another man had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
claiming the authorship of &ldquo;To
Lalage.&rdquo; Luckily, perhaps, he
failed to find out who this miscreant
was, or probably his indignation
would have overcome his
prudence, and he would at any
cost have claimed his own.</p>

<p>The secret was well kept; and
Adrian received the usual check at
Christmas-time, and with it the
usual invitation to spend the festive
season with his uncle, and to bring
with him his young friend Peter
Allison, to whom old Mr. Pottles
had taken a great fancy. Peter
was a man of many engagements,
but, sought after as he was and
proclaimed himself to be, he remembered
the good cheer at Mr.
Pottles&rsquo;, and accepted the invitation.
They went down together;
Adrian bewailing his hard fortune
and denouncing the impostor;
Peter warmly sympathizing, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
counseling continued silence and
prudence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, if I could only claim it!&rdquo;
cried Adrian, opening his Gladstone
bag and gazing fondly at half
a dozen neat, clean copies of &ldquo;To
Lalage.&rdquo; &ldquo;I should be the lion
of the season, Peter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter smiled and shook his head.
&ldquo;A fortune is better than fame,
Adrian,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>For a day or two all went well
at Clapham. The old gentleman
was in the best of tempers, and the
two young men did their best to
keep him in it, indorsing all his
views as to the lax morality and
disgraceful tone which pervaded
modern literature and modern
society; and when they had done
their duty in this way they rewarded
themselves by going in
next door and having tea with
Dora Chatterton, a young lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
whom they both thought charming.
Indeed, Adrian thought her
so charming that, after a short
acquaintance, he sent her a copy
of &ldquo;To Lalage&rdquo;&mdash;with the author&rsquo;s
kind regards. Now, Miss Dora
Chatterton adored genius. She
had thought both Adrian and Peter
very pleasant young men; she had
perceived that they both thought
her a very pleasant young woman;
and she had been rather puzzled to
know which of them she would, in
a certain event, make up her mind
to prefer. &ldquo;To Lalage&rdquo; settled
the question. It was the gifted
author, A.&nbsp;P., who deserved her
love; and A.&nbsp;P. obviously stood,
not for Peter Allison, but for
Adrian Pottles.</p>

<p>The very next morning she
called early at Mr. Pottles&rsquo;. She
found him alone; the boys, he
explained, had gone for a walk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Dora was disappointed; but, failing
the author himself, she was
content to pour her praises into
the ears of an appreciative and
proud uncle. She did so, expressing
immense admiration for
Adrian&rsquo;s modesty in not having
told Mr. Pottles of his achievement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Mr. Pottles.
&ldquo;Let me see these&mdash;er&mdash;things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The effect of &ldquo;To Lalage&rdquo; on
Mr. Pottles was surprising, and
particularly so to Dora. In less
than ten minutes she found herself
being shown the door, and
intrusted with a letter to her
mother in which Mr. Pottles stated
that she had been reading wicked
books, and ought, in his opinion,
to be sent to her own room for an
indefinite period.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I shall know if you don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
give it her,&rdquo; said Mr. Pottles
viciously.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Adrian
and Peter, as they were returning,
met poor Dora on the steps with
this horrid note in one hand and
her pocket-handkerchief in the
other&mdash;for Mrs. Chatterton shared
Mr. Pottles&rsquo; views, and Dora did
not enjoy having to deliver the
note. They were just hastening
up to speak to her, when Mr.
Pottles himself appeared on the
steps, holding out &ldquo;To Lalage&rdquo;
in his hand. Adrian grasped the
situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Peter,&rdquo;
he whispered, &ldquo;say you wrote the
beastly thing; I&rsquo;m ruined if you
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh? But he&rsquo;ll kick me out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand a pony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Two</em>,&rdquo; said Peter firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, two; but be quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Peter spoke up like a
man, and accepted the blame of
&ldquo;To Lalage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your initials aren&rsquo;t A.
P.,&rdquo; objected Mr. Pottles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To avoid suspicion, I reversed
the order; mine are P.&nbsp;A.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;James,&rdquo; said Mr. Pottles to
the footman, &ldquo;pack Mr. Allison&rsquo;s
bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dora gave Peter the kindest
and most admiring glance as
she murmured softly to Adrian,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re lovely! Oh, don&rsquo;t you
wish you could write verses, Mr.
Pottles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adrian started. He had not
bargained for this; but Peter had
overheard, and interposed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am more than consoled by
your approval, Miss Chatterton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pottles called to Adrian,
and he had to go in, leaving Dora
and Peter in close conversation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and to assure his uncle solemnly
that he had been entirely disappointed
and deceived in Peter,
and, worse still, in Dora, and that
he never wished to see either of
them again. Mr. Pottles shook
him by the hand and forgave him.</p>

<p>Adrian passed a wretched week.
In several newspapers he saw it
openly stated that Peter now admitted
he was the author of &ldquo;To
Lalage.&rdquo; Peter wrote that the fifty
pounds were most convenient, and
that he had had a most charming
letter from Dora, and that all the
literary world was paying him
most flattering attentions. Adrian
ground his teeth, but he had to
write back, thanking Peter for all
his kindness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Pottles grew
restless. Every paper he took up
was full of the praises of &ldquo;To
Lalage.&rdquo; The author was becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
famous, and Mr. Pottles began
to doubt whether he had done well
to drive him forth with contumely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adrian,&rdquo; he said suddenly one
morning, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I
did justice to young Allison. I
shall have another look at that
book. I shall order it at
Smith&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I happen to have a copy,&rdquo;
said Adrian timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get it,&rdquo; said Mr. Pottles.
Mr. Pottles read it&mdash;first with a
deep frown, then with a judicial
air, then with a smile, lastly with
a chuckle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask him to dinner,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Oh, and, Adrian, we&rsquo;ll have the
Chattertons. I wish you could do
something to get your name up,
my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You like it, uncle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I like the manly way
he owned to it. If he had prevaricated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
about it, I&rsquo;d never have
forgiven him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this Adrian did not dare
to confess. It was too bad.
Here were both his uncle and
Dora admiring Peter for his
poems, and crediting Peter with
candor and courage. He was to
lose both fame and Dora! It was
certainly too much. A sudden
thought struck him. He went to
town, called on Peter, and, as the
police reports say, &ldquo;made a communication&rdquo;
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes me look a scoundrel,&rdquo;
objected Peter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two hundred&mdash;at six months,&rdquo;
suggested Adrian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she is a nice girl&mdash;&mdash; No,
I&rsquo;m dashed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A monkey at three!&rdquo; cried
Adrian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

<p>It was a sad tale of depravity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
on one side, and of self-sacrificing
friendship on the other, that Mr.
Pottles and Dora Chatterton listened
to that evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had made,&rdquo; said Adrian
sadly, &ldquo;a deliberate attempt to rob
me of my fame before, and he
repeated it. And yet, uncle, an
old friend&mdash;boyhood&rsquo;s companion&mdash;how
could I betray him? It
was weak, but I could not. I
stood by, and let him deceive
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a noble fellow,&rdquo; said
Mr. Pottles, in tones of emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes,&rdquo; said Dora, with
an adoring glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, let us say no more
about it,&rdquo; pursued Adrian magnanimously.
&ldquo;I have my reward,&rdquo;
and he returned Dora&rsquo;s glance
behind Mr. Pottles&rsquo; broad back.</p>

<p>The next time he met Peter,
he said, &ldquo;I am really immensely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
indebted to you, old fellow. My
uncle has come down handsome,
and if the monkey now would be
conv&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Gad, yes!&rdquo; said Peter.
He took it in crisp notes, and
carefully pocketed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is Miss Dora kind?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an angel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you are generally prosperous?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to you, my dear old
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Peter, producing
a piece of paper from his pocket,
&ldquo;you might persuade your publishers
to withdraw this beastly
thing.&rdquo; It was a writ, and it
claimed an injunction to restrain
Peter from claiming the authorship
of &ldquo;To Lalage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been publicly
claiming it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to keep up the illusion,
Adrian. Do me justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Adrian, &ldquo;how,
Peter&mdash;how does it happen that
the writ is dated the day <em>before</em>
we went to Clapham?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused. Peter grinned
uneasily. A light broke in on
Adrian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
the villain who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Wonderfully provident
of me, wasn&rsquo;t it? What,
you&rsquo;re not going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never let me see your face
again,&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;I have
done with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rushed out. Peter whistled
gently, and said to himself, &ldquo;Not
a bad deal! He must stop the
action, or the old man will twig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he whistled again, and
added, &ldquo;Glad I got it in notes.
He&rsquo;d have stopped a check.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>A third time he whistled, and
chuckled and said, &ldquo;Now, I wonder
if old Adrian&rsquo;ll make five
hundred and fifty out of it! Not
a bad deal, Peter, my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>MIDDLETON&rsquo;S MODEL.</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_m.png" width="69" height="70" alt="M" title="M" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Middleton</span> was doing
very well; everybody admitted
that&mdash;some patronizingly,
others enviously. And
yet Middleton aimed high. He
eschewed pot-boilers, and devoted
himself to important subject pictures,
often of an allegorical
description. Nevertheless, his
works sold, and that so well that
Middleton thought himself justified
in taking a wife. Here,
again, good fortune attended him.
Miss Angela Dove was fair to see,
possessed of a nice little income,
and, finally, a lady of taste, for
she accepted Middleton&rsquo;s addresses.
Decidedly a lucky fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
all round was Middleton. But,
in spite of all his luck, his face was
clouded with care as he sat in
his studio one summer evening.
Three months before he had been
the recipient of a most flattering
commission from that wealthy and
esteemed connoisseur the Earl of
Moneyton. The earl desired two
panels for his hall. &ldquo;I want,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;two full-length female
figures&mdash;the one representing
Heavenly Love, the other Earthly
Love. Not a very new subject,
you will say; but I have a fancy
for it, and I can rely on your
talent to impart freshness even to
a well-worn theme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course there was no difficulty
about Heavenly Love. Angela
filled the bill (the expression was
Middleton&rsquo;s own) to a nicety.
Her pretty golden hair, her sweet
smile, her candid blue eyes, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
exactly what was wanted. Middleton
clapped on a pair of wings,
and felt that he had done his duty.
But when he came to Earthly
Love the path was not so smooth.
The earl demanded the acme of
physical beauty, and that was
rather hard to find. Middleton
tried all the models in vain; he
frequented the theaters and music-halls
to no purpose; he tried to
combine all the beauties of his
acquaintance in one harmonious
whole, but they did not make
what tea-dealers call a &ldquo;nice
blend.&rdquo; Then he tried to evolve
Earthly Love out of his own consciousness,
but he could get
nothing there but Angela again;
and although he did violence to
his feelings by giving her black
hair and an evil cast in her eye,
he knew that, even thus transformed,
she would not satisfy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
earl. Middleton was in despair;
his reputation was at stake. The
thought of Angela could not console
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give my soul for a model!&rdquo;
cried he, flinging aside his pencil
in despair.</p>

<p>At this moment he heard a
knock at the door. He existed
on the charwoman system, and
after six o&rsquo;clock in the evening
had to open his own door. A
lady stood outside, and a neat
brougham was vanishing round
the corner. Even in the darkness
Middleton was struck by the
grace and dignity of his visitor&rsquo;s
figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Middleton&rsquo;s, is it not?&rdquo;
she asked, in a very sweet voice.</p>

<p>Middleton bowed. It was late
for a call, but if the lady ignored
that fact, he could not remind her
of it. Fortunately there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
chance of Angela coming at such
an hour. He led the way to his
studio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;to
what I am indebted for this
honor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you like coming to business
directly,&rdquo; she answered, her
neatly gloved hands busy unpinning
her veil. She seemed to find
the task a little difficult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s rather late,&rdquo; said
Middleton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I am only just
up. Well, then, to business. I
hear you want a model for an
Earthly Love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. May I ask if
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I am a model? Oh, now
and then&mdash;not habitually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know my requirements
are somewhat hard to fulfill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can fulfill them,&rdquo; and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
raised her veil. She certainly
could. She realized his wildest
dreams&mdash;the wildest dream of poets
and painters since the world began.
Middleton stood half-stupefied before
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, shall I do?&rdquo; she asked,
turning her smile on him.</p>

<p>Middleton felt as if it were a
battery of guns, as he answered
that he would be the happiest
painter in the world if she would
honor him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Head only, of course,&rdquo; she
continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he hastily;
&ldquo;unless, that is, you will give me
hands and arms too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not. My hands are
not so good.&rdquo; And she glanced
at her kid gauntlets with a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;er&mdash;as to terms?&rdquo; he
stammered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the usual terms,&rdquo; she
answered briskly.</p>

<p>Middleton hinted at pre-payment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not allowed to take that,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Come, I will ask for
what I want when the time comes.
You won&rsquo;t refuse me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little vague,&rdquo; he said,
with an uneasy laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can go away.&rdquo; And
she turned toward the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever you like,&rdquo; he cried
hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s better. I shall not
take anything of great value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him her hand. He
ventured on a slight pressure.
The lady did not seem to notice
it, and her hand lay quite motionless
in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, then?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I won&rsquo;t trouble you to
call a cab. I shall walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you far to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, some little way; but it&rsquo;s
an easy road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I escort you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-night. Some day, I
hope&rdquo;&mdash;and she stepped into the
street and disappeared round the
corner.</p>

<p>Punctually the next day she reappeared.
Apart from her incomparable
beauty&mdash;and every time
she came, Middleton was more
convinced that it was incomparable&mdash;she
was a charming companion.
She was very well read,
and her knowledge of the world
was wonderful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it wasn&rsquo;t rude to ask
your age!&rdquo; he exclaimed one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I am older than I look.
My work keeps me young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you very busy, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am always busy. But I
don&rsquo;t grudge the time I give to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
you. No, don&rsquo;t thank me. I am
to be paid, you know.&rdquo; And she
laughed merrily. If there were a
flaw in her, it was her laugh.
Middleton thought it rather a
cruel laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he resumed,
&ldquo;you have never told me your
name yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incognita</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will tell me some day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you shall know some
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we part forever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shall not part&mdash;forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Middleton said he hoped not;
but what would Angela say?</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is not so pretty a
one as your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée&rsquo;s</i>,&rdquo; the lady
continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know I am engaged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always know that sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
thing. It&rsquo;s so useful. Angela
Dove, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I hope you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be candid, not very much.
It happens to have unpleasant
associations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Angela
was staying out of town. Middleton
felt that the two ladies would
not have got on well together;
and&mdash;&mdash; He checked himself
in shame; for his thought had
been that not even for Angela
could he send the stranger away.
Middleton struggled against the
treacherous passion that grew
upon him; but he struggled in
vain. He was guilty of postponing
the finishing of his panel as
long as he could. At last the lady
grew impatient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not come after to-day,&rdquo;
she announced. &ldquo;You can finish
it to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hardly!&rdquo; he protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay late; but I can&rsquo;t come
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Middleton worked hard, and by
evening the panel was finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ll have something
to eat, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She agreed, and they sat down
to a merry meal. The lady surpassed
herself in brilliancy, and
her mad gayety infected Middleton.
Forgetful of his honor and
allegiance, he leaned over to toast
his guest, with a passionate gaze in
his eyes. Insensibly the evening
sped away; suddenly the clock
struck twelve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going now,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you won&rsquo;t leave me!&rdquo;
cried Middleton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when shall I see you
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as you like, but not
later than you must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are charmingly mysterious.
Tell me where you are going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t come to me, I
shall come to you,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will come to me,&rdquo;
she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we shall be together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as ever I like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible! Eternity would
not be too long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous verrons</i>,&rdquo; said she, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least you will write?
You&rsquo;ll send me your picture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never write, and you have
my picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And another in my heart,&rdquo; he
cried hotly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have tried to put it there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But give me some token&mdash;anything&mdash;a
ribbon&mdash;a glove&mdash;anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let it be a glove. As I
go I will give you a glove.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose from her chair and
rested her right hand on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Till we meet again!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am yours for ever!&rdquo; he cried,
seizing her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True! true!&rdquo; she answered
triumphantly. &ldquo;You are mine forever!&rdquo;
and with a sudden movement
she drew her arm away from
him and left on the table&mdash;her
glove, was it, or her hand? It
seemed her very hand! and as
Middleton looked up he had a
vision of a blood-red claw shaken
in his face, and devilish laughter
rattled in his ears. The lady was
gone, and Middleton fell full
length on his studio floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Middleton is a very devoted
husband to Angela Dove. When
he is well and cheerful, he blames
himself for having made love to a
model, and laughs at himself for
having been fool enough to fancy&mdash;well,
all sorts of rubbish. But
when he is out of sorts he does not
like to be complimented on his
figure of Earthly Love, and he
gives a shudder if he happens to
come across an article which lies
hidden in his cupboard&mdash;a perfect
model of the human hand covered
with black kid; the model is hollow,
and there is a curious black
mark inside it.</p>

<p>And the earl? The earl was
delighted with the panel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was she a professional
model?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She made it a matter of business
with me,&rdquo; said Middleton uneasily.
It was one of his bad days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I must know that girl,&rdquo; continued
the earl, with a cunning
look in his eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect you will some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She didn&rsquo;t tell
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she sign anything when
you paid her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t paid her yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose so,&rdquo; answered
Middleton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll find out who she
is then. And, I say, Middleton,
just let me know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will if I can&mdash;unless you&rsquo;ve
found it out before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The earl took up his hat with a
sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A glorious creature!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I hope I shall see her sometime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s very likely, my
lord,&rdquo; said Middleton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any notion where
she comes from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Middleton compromised. He
said he understood that the lady
was from Monte Carlo.</p>

<h2>MY ASTRAL BODY.</h2>

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There&rsquo;s</span> no doubt at all
about it,&rdquo; said the rajah,
relighting his cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly easy, if you know
how to do it. The skepticism of
the West is nothing less than disgusting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rajah had come to Oxford
to complete his education and
endue himself with the culture of
Europe; and he sat in my rooms,
in a frock-coat of perfect cut (he
always wore a frock-coat), smoking
one of my weeds and drinking
a whisky-and-soda. The rajah
took to European culture with
avidity, and I have very little
doubt that he learned many new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
things with which it might or might
not be expedient to acquaint his
fellow-countrymen and subjects
when he returned to India. But
all the intellectual interests of
Oxford were not strong enough to
wean him from his love for the
ancient lore of his own country,
and he was always ready to expound
the hidden wisdom of the
East to any inquiring spirit. As
soon as I found this out, I cultivated
his acquaintance sedulously;
for, in common with all intelligent
men of the present day, I took a
keen interest in that strange learning
which seemed to give its possessors
such extraordinary powers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you do it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope so,&rdquo; said the
rajah contemptuously. &ldquo;If I
couldn&rsquo;t do that, I&rsquo;d turn Mahommedan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d teach me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>The rajah took in a deep puff
of smoke. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you
could manage it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, like anything
else, an astral body must be
treated with tact, or it gets out of
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; you must be firm
and yet kind. Don&rsquo;t let it take
liberties, or you don&rsquo;t know where
it will land you. I rather doubt
if I ought to show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I implored him to do so. I was
young, rash, self-confident, and I
thought I could manage an astral
body as easily as I did the dean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me if you find it
too much for you, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said
the rajah. &ldquo;And of course you
must promise not to tell anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, must I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you must; because it&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
quite irregular in me to show you
like this. You ought, by rights,
you know, to go to Thibet for
seven years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be rather a bore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beastly,&rdquo; said the rajah; &ldquo;but
of course they insist on it, because
they get the fees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He swore me to secrecy by all
manner of oaths, and lastly on my
word as a gentleman; and then
he showed me. I practiced all
that evening, and was tolerably
proficient by the time the rajah
knocked out his last pipe and went
off to bed. I must not tell how
it is done, as I promised not to;
besides, if anyone reads this narrative
through, he will never want
to know.</p>

<p>At first it was very convenient.
I always used to project it to
chapel instead of going myself.
It did capitally there, because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
had only to behave itself and hold
its tongue. At lectures it was a
failure; it was such an inattentive
beggar that its notes were worth
nothing. And it was no sort of
use in the Torpid; I was told that
I should be turned out if I went
on &ldquo;sugaring&rdquo; like that&mdash;there&rsquo;s
no pluck or endurance in these
Orientals. On the whole, however,
I was very well satisfied with
it, and came to rely upon it more
and more for all the unpleasant
duties of life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how do you like it?&rdquo;
asked the rajah one day in Quad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, it&rsquo;s splendid,&rdquo;
I answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up in town,
being measured for trousers, now.
You can&rsquo;t think how much trouble
it saves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rajah smiled and shook his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be moderate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
mustn&rsquo;t use it too much, or it&rsquo;ll
presume on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it? What will it do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, if it&rsquo;s always being projected,
it&rsquo;s as likely as not it&rsquo;ll
learn the trick of it, and take to
projecting itself. Then you&rsquo;ll be
left in the lurch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you can do,&rdquo;
said the rajah, scratching his head.
&ldquo;Of course, I should merely report
it at headquarters; but you
can&rsquo;t, because you&rsquo;ve no business
with it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I shan&rsquo;t grudge it a
holiday now and then,&rdquo; I said
magnanimously.</p>

<p>The rajah was right. It did
begin to take French leave.
Several times when I wanted it I
found it had, without a word of
apology, projected itself off to
Iffley or somewhere, and was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
available. I spoke very severely
to it. It said nothing, but listened
with an unpleasant sort of
smile. &ldquo;We all have our duties,&rdquo;
I remarked, &ldquo;and yours is to be
here&rdquo;&mdash;and I pointed to my chest&mdash;&ldquo;when
you are wanted. You&rsquo;re
as bad as a scout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to have a little relaxation,&rdquo;
it answered sulkily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of such a thing
in connection with you. Isn&rsquo;t it
enough for you to meditate in four
dimensions when you&rsquo;re not at
work? That would satisfy most
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well in Thibet,&rdquo; it
grumbled; &ldquo;but a fellow doesn&rsquo;t
come to Oxford to do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One would think you had nothing
to do with me. You seem to
forget that you are simply a projection
of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had some high words and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
parted&mdash;I mean, united&mdash;in very
bad temper with one another. It
was in the middle of a most impertinent
and positively threatening
speech, when I terminated the interview
by resuming it. It was
very unreasonable and irritating,
and I made up my mind to ask the
rajah to speak to it the next morning.
I had an engagement that
evening, or I would have done it
then. How I wish I had!</p>

<p>At half-past nine I went to an
&ldquo;At Home&rdquo; at Professor Drayton&rsquo;s.
As a rule, &ldquo;At Homes&rdquo;
are dull; but I had a reason for
going to this one. The professor
had a very pretty daughter, and I
was vain enough to think that my
presence was welcome to her. In
fact, we were great friends, and I
had not been at the house a quarter
of an hour before I had forgotten
all my worries with my unruly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Astral Body, and was sitting by
Bessie in the small drawing room,
enjoying myself immensely. Suddenly&mdash;mysteriously&mdash;I
felt something
like a violent push. Bessie
vanished; the drawing room vanished;
and I found myself in the
High, standing in dripping rain,
without a hat or coat. I stood
still in bewilderment. What had
happened? A moment later the
proctor was upon me. I gave my
name and college in a mechanical
way, and he passed on, leaving me
still standing in the rain. What
had happened? Then it flashed
across my mind. I understood its
threats. It had projected me!</p>

<p>I woke up next morning, determined
to have it out with it. I
found, as I expected, that it had
waited till I was asleep; then it
slunk in and united without my
knowing it. I went and paid my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
fine, and then, not waiting to
breakfast, I proceeded to project
it. It wouldn&rsquo;t move! I tried
again and again. I had no more
power over it than a child. I
knew it was there; but I could not
move it an inch. In wrath, I
jumped up, seized my cap, and
started for the rajah&rsquo;s rooms.
The rogue saw what I was up to.
I give you my word, I had not
reached the door when it projected
me most viciously, and I landed
down in the Parks.</p>

<p>I was not to be beaten. I came
back to college at a run, and made
straight for the rajah&rsquo;s rooms. It
was on the lookout for me. As
I ran by my oak, which I had to
pass, it rushed out on me, united,
and projected me back again to
Magdalen Bridge. This happened
three times. Then I sat
down in the Parks, just where I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
dropped, and acknowledged to
myself that I was in a pretty fix.</p>

<p>I had a fearful week of it. Of
course, wherever I was, it could
unite at once by just thinking of
me; and, directly it had united,
it used, I believe out of pure
malice, to project me somewhere
where I did not want to go. It
was lucky for me that it was new
to the business; its powers were
as yet very undeveloped, and,
consequently, it did not carry very
far. If it could, I am sure it
would have sent me to the Antipodes;
but as it was, I never
went further than the University
boat-house&mdash;a pretty tidy step on
a bad morning. Still, it was improving;
and I felt that I must
act at once if I did not want to be
a permanent wanderer on the face
of the earth.</p>

<p>My only chance was to engross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
its attention in some way, so that
it would forget me for a little
while, and leave me free to speak
to the rajah. I pinned all my
hopes on the rajah. Well, one
morning, about a week after it
first projected me, I went for a
walk in Christchurch Meadow.
We were united, and it had actually
left me in peace ever since
breakfast. I hoped its better
feelings were beginning to get the
mastery of it, and, in order to see,
I tried to project it. No, it
wouldn&rsquo;t move! The creature
was still recalcitrant.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw Bessie Drayton
just in front of me. In delight
at seeing her, I forgot about it,
and, quickening my pace, overtook
her, and lifted my hat. She
smiled divinely, saying, &ldquo;Why,
Mr. Nares, I just going to
write&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; At that moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
when I was listening to her sweet
voice, it projected me! Could
ill-nature go further? But, luckily,
its mind was not really concentrated
on what it was doing. I
believe it was thinking of Bessie,
and consequently it only carried
about a hundred yards. I landed
behind one of the big elms, where
I lay <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perdu</i> till it had gone by.
It and Bessie passed me together,
and it was grinning from ear to
ear, and looked as pleased as
Punch. And poor Bessie, who
thought she was talking to me,
was being most charming to it.</p>

<p>I did not waste time in swearing.
I ran like the wind back to college,
hoping that Bessie&rsquo;s society would
prevent it coming after me till I
had spoken to the rajah. I still
retained one pull over it. In
order to unite, it had to come
where I was; it could not resume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
me from a distance, as I used to
resume it; so if it united now it
would have to leave Bessie.</p>

<p>By a blessed chance, the rajah
was at home, and in trembling
haste I poured my story into his
ear. He burst out laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid of it!&rdquo; he gasped,
holding his sides. &ldquo;How splendid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I restrained my annoyance, and
after a time he became a little
more grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do help me!&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;It
may unite at any moment, and
project me the deuce knows
where.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;ll be all right with the
young lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for long. She&rsquo;s very particular,
and won&rsquo;t let it walk far
with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then we must act. You
don&rsquo;t feel it yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but do be quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rajah sported his oak, took
off his coat, lay down on the floor,
and went into strong convulsions.</p>

<p>I regretted putting him to so
much trouble, but my need was
urgent, and I knew that he was a
good-natured man. Presently he
cried (and I was just getting
alarmed about him):</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you there, Nani-Tal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said an old white-haired
gentleman, dressed in a
sheet, who sat in the rajah&rsquo;s armchair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the
rajah, getting up and putting on his
coat. &ldquo;You were very difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so busy just now,&rdquo; said
Nani-Tal apologetically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
demonstrating three nights a
week, and the preparations take
all my time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t have a boom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
for nothing,&rdquo; said the rajah, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t complain,&rdquo; said Nani-Tal;
&ldquo;I only mentioned it to excuse
myself for keeping you waiting.
I was in New York when
you began materializing. It&rsquo;s a
lively city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must tell him all about
it,&rdquo; said the rajah to me; &ldquo;he
won&rsquo;t be very hard on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nani-Tal was, however, rather
severe. He said it was too bad of
the rajah. How were they to live,
if that sort of thing went on?
Then he turned to me, and added,
&ldquo;Of course you couldn&rsquo;t manage
it. If you&rsquo;d gone through the
course, you would have been all
right. But there, it&rsquo;s everything
for nothing nowadays!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend couldn&rsquo;t go to
Thibet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might have paid the fees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
anyhow,&rdquo; grumbled Nani-Tal,
&ldquo;and taken correspondence lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We smoothed him down with
the promise of a handsome donation,
and at last he consented to
help us. It was only just in time,
for at that very moment I felt my
Astral Body uniting. A second
later it made a violent effort to
project me; of course, it saw
Nani-Tal, and knew it was in for
it. The old gentleman was too
quick for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out of that!&rdquo; he cried
imperiously, and the wretch stood
in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>It did my heart good to hear
Nani-Tal fall on the creature.
After giving it no end of a lecture,
he concluded, &ldquo;And now, young
man, you&rsquo;ll just go back to your
jackal for a thousand years, and
learn better manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The wretch protested; it asked
for an elephant or even a tiger.
Nani-Tal was obdurate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A jackal will just suit you,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Be off!&rdquo; The creature
vanished. Simultaneously
Nani-Tal began to disintegrate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit!&rdquo; cried the rajah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m summoned to St.
James&rsquo; Hall. There&rsquo;s a large
audience, and the professor has
been in convulsions seven minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to grasp his hand in
thanks. &ldquo;If you want another,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you must go through the
course&mdash;the full course. There&rsquo;s
no other way. Let this be a lesson
to you.&rdquo; And with this parting
remark he disintegrated.</p>

<p>The rajah lit a cigar, and I,
lighter at heart than I had been
for many days, followed his example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was wrong of me,&rdquo; said the
rajah; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity it turned out so
badly,&rdquo; I remarked; &ldquo;it was quite
a comfort at first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all like that, unless
you keep a tight hand on them.
Shall you take the course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I. I&rsquo;ve had enough of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right. Excuse
me; I have to go to the Deccan
on business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fell back on the sofa, apparently
in a trance, and I went off
to the dean&rsquo;s lecture. It makes
all the difference whether you
know how to do a thing or not.</p>

<h2>THE NEBRASKA LOADSTONE.</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_i.png" width="71" height="71" alt="I" title="I" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">If</span> there was one man in
college whom the rajah
thoroughly and heartily
detested, it was the captain of the
boat club. He had many faults;
he was very tall and powerful, and
delighted in contrasting the English
physique with that of inferior
races; by which he meant, among
others, the rajah&rsquo;s race. His
manner was abrupt and overbearing,
his laugh loud and unmusical.
In fact, he grated horribly on the
rajah; and it was merely the final
straw when, in the exhilaration of
a bump supper,&mdash;full, as the rajah
remarked in disgust, of cow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
strong drink,&mdash;he called that
prince, in playful chaff, a &ldquo;nigger.&rdquo;
The rajah swore melodiously
in Hindustani, and I saw
that he meant to be revenged.</p>

<p>In those days the entertainment
of the Nebraska Loadstone created
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">furore</i>. Everybody went to see
her, and everybody came away
convinced that she possessed marvelous
powers. Her peculiar gift&mdash;but
everybody remembers the
details of the performance, and
how the tricks were finally, one by
one, exposed, so that her adherents
and believers were driven from
one position to another, until at
last they had to fall back on one
single performance out of all those
that the Loadstone gave, and maintain
that on that occasion at least
something unexplained and inexplicable
did really happen. It is
with the events of that particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
evening that I am concerned. I
think I can throw some light on
them.</p>

<p>At first, however, there were
many believers and few skeptics.
The dean carefully pointed out
that Plato nowhere denied the
existence of odic force; and the
bursar, who was generally supposed
to be little better than an
atheist, declared that Spencer in
one passage impliedly asserted it;
even the warden, in his sermon,
told us that it was better, according
to Bacon, to believe two errors
than refuse one truth&mdash;which was,
to say the least of it, sitting on the
fence. But none of these authorities
shook the robust skepticism of
the captain of the boat club. He
knew a conjurer, and the conjurer
had told him how it was done, and
he was going to expose the Loadstone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But why haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I
urged. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been here a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will not be too hard on her
at first,&rdquo; said the rajah, with a
little sneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bust her up this very
night,&rdquo; said Waterer. &ldquo;I would
have done it before, only I was
gated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The excuse was good, and
Waterer departed, full of boastings
and self-confidence, to gather together
a large number of the noisy
men, and make a pleasant party to
&ldquo;guy&rdquo; the unhappy Loadstone. I
stayed to smoke a pipe with the
rajah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s a fraud,&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;and I believe that animal
really has got hold of the right
explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go and see it,&rdquo; I announced.</p>

<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silent smoking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the rajah looked up with a
twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;So shall I&mdash;if
niggers are admitted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After hall, he and I set out
together for the town hall. We
found the first two rows of stalls
occupied by Waterer and his
friends. They were all in evening
dress, and had obviously dined&mdash;not
in hall. The rajah and I
seated ourselves just behind them.
The room was full, and the feats
were being most successful; each
was followed by general applause,
broken only by some gibes from
our friends in front. These latter
grew so pronounced that the Loadstone&rsquo;s
manager at last came forward
and pointedly invited one of
the scoffers to submit himself to
experiment.</p>

<p>Now was Waterer&rsquo;s chance.
He rose in the majesty of his bulk,
walked on to the platform, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
said in a loud voice, as he settled
himself on a chair, &ldquo;If the lady
can move me one foot from this
chair, I&rsquo;ll give her a pony!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Loadstone advanced and
began to paw him about in her
usual fashion. Waterer, who was
sober enough to have lost nothing
but his shyness, was apparently
too many for her. He was immovable;
and cries of, &ldquo;Now
then! when are you going to
begin?&rdquo; and so on, became
audible. Two or three minutes
passed, and the Loadstone turned
with a gesture of despair toward
her manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>

<p>I jumped to my feet, crying,
&ldquo;Wait a minute! Look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For even as she spoke, there
was what is scientifically called a
solution of continuity between
Waterer and his chair. Still in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
a sitting posture, but sitting on
nothing, he was at least two inches
from the wicker-work of the chair.
I glanced from him to the rajah.
That extraordinary man was in
deep, placid, profound slumber.
I jogged his elbow and pinched
his arm; he showed no consciousness
whatever. I looked at the
Loadstone. She was standing
motionless on the stage about a
yard from Waterer, with one hand
outstretched toward him, and her
eyes fixed on his ascending figure;
for Waterer was gradually, slowly,
steadily mounting in his strange
journey. He was now a foot from
his chair, still in a sitting position&mdash;and
up, up, up he was going.
The wretch was white as a
sheet, and gasping with fright and
bewilderment. Thunders of applause
burst from the audience.
It was again and again renewed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
but the Loadstone did not, as her
custom was, bow and smile in
response. She still stood motionless,
and Waterer still ascended.</p>

<p>At last, at a height of fully
twenty feet from the stage, he
stopped. Simultaneously the
Loadstone gave a loud shriek as
she fell back into the arms of the
manager&mdash;and the rajah awoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said
politely; &ldquo;I was drowsy. Anything
going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s stopped now,&rdquo; I
answered, my eyes eagerly fixed
on Waterer.</p>

<p>The rajah rose from his seat
with a yawn. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be
nothing more to-night,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home, man!&mdash;with that
before our eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rajah shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t do anything more,&rdquo;
he repeated. &ldquo;Look at her; she&rsquo;s
quite done up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, indeed, the Loadstone
looked half dead as she gazed
fearfully up at Waterer. Her
demeanor was not that of a
triumphant performer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do sit down,&rdquo; I urged; &ldquo;we
must see the end of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a weary sigh, the rajah sat
down, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure you
will, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While we talked, the audience
grew impatient. However wonderful
a feat may be, the public
likes to have things kept moving.
They thought Waterer had been
in the air long enough, and there
were cries of &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do! Let
him down!&rdquo; &ldquo;Give us another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The manager held a hasty conference
with the Loadstone: he
seemed to urge her; but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
shook her head again and again,
and would do nothing but lie back
in a chair, and pass her hand to
and fro over her head. The rajah
looked at her with a slight smile.
The clamor increased. I think a
sort of panic&mdash;an angry panic&mdash;seized
the audience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring him down! Bring him
down!&rdquo; they cried, pointing to
the pallid Waterer, who sat as
rigid as a trussed fowl.</p>

<p>After another despairing appeal
to the Loadstone, the manager
came forward and made a lame
speech. The Loadstone was exhausted
with her unparalleled
exertions. She must rest; presently
she would bring him down.
Then Waterer&rsquo;s friends arose and
ascended the platform. They
walked about, they stood on one
another&rsquo;s shoulders; they made it
clear that no cords held Waterer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
A pair of steps was called for and
brought. Placed on a sturdy
table, they just enabled a man
to reach Waterer&rsquo;s feet. One
mounted amidst intense excitement.
Turning to the rajah, I
exclaimed, &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was asleep again; and the
Loadstone stood stiffly upright,
beckoning toward Waterer. Slowly
and gradually he descended, leaving
the man on the ladder grasping
at empty air, till he sat again
on his seat. The applause burst
out, and the Loadstone sank back
in a faint on the floor. The rajah
awoke, and the manager dropped
the curtain, hiding the Loadstone,
Waterer, and his friends from
our view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me your arm,&rdquo; said the
rajah; &ldquo;I am tired.&rdquo; I escorted
him to a cab, and we drove home.</p>

<p>The Loadstone gave no performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the next evening: she
was too fatigued; and Waterer
was absent from the boat and
from the sight of men two days.
When he reappeared he made no
reference to his friend the conjurer.
He slunk about the Quad,
looking very pale and upset. I
met him once, when I was with the
rajah, on our way to lecture. The
rajah smiled urbanely at Waterer,
and said to me, when he had passed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a rude thing to call a
gentleman a nigger, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Waterer has not done it again.
And the Loadstone never did that
trick again. She took the pony,
though. The manager called on
Waterer, and asked for a check.
I think that incident pleased the
rajah most of all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a ready utilization of the
unexpected,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;which
does our friend much credit.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A SUCCESSFUL REHEARSAL.</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_m.png" width="69" height="70" alt="M" title="M" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mr. Aloysius Tappenham</span>,
of Stamford
Road, was a dealer in
frauds. It must not be understood
from this statement that he
was either a company-promoter or
the manager of a philanthropic
undertaking. On the contrary,
he was as honest a man of business
as you would find in London,
and he earned his living by discovering
and introducing new
attractions in the shape of &ldquo;Wonders,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Phenomenons,&rdquo; and so
forth. The music-halls were Mr.
Tappenham&rsquo;s best customers, and
when he successfully launched a
new impostor, he reaped a handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
return in the way of commissions
on the salary of the impostor
and the profits of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrepreneur</i>.
All his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégés</i> were
a success&mdash;a fact chiefly to be attributed
to his unvarying habit of
insisting that he himself should be
shown &ldquo;how it was done.&rdquo; He
promised and observed absolute
secrecy; but, as he always said, he
could not properly judge of the
merit of any particular fraud, unless
he were allowed a private view
of the machinery by which it was
worked. Some few years ago, in
the very prime of life and the full
tide of a profitable trade, Mr.
Tappenham suddenly retired from
business. This was the reason:</p>

<p>One day Mr. Tappenham discovered
a treasure in the shape of
a very attractive young lady whose
name was Hopkins, but who proposed
to call herself Mlle. Claire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Claire was hardly suitable to
the music-halls; Mr. Tappenham
thought that she was above that,
and proposed to &ldquo;run&rdquo; her himself
in Bond Street, on half-profit
terms. Her specialty was the
production of any spirit you liked
to order. She received in a dimly
lighted room; you told her who
you were, and whose spirit you
wished to interview, and forthwith,
without any nonsense of
hand-holding or table-turning, she
caused to appear a shadowy yet
clearly perceptible figure which
was exactly like the person you
named, spoke with that person&rsquo;s
voice, and exhibited full&mdash;or reasonably
full&mdash;knowledge of everything
which that person, and that
person only, might be expected to
know.</p>

<p>Mr. Tappenham was much
struck with the dexterity of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
performance. Of course, when
explained, it resolved itself into
some clever optical illusion, a little
ventriloquism, and a good deal
of tact in returning to the inquirer
in another form information
pumped out of him beforehand.
The materials were simple, the
result was highly artistic; and Mr.
Tappenham determined to furnish
the only thing needful to set London
aflame with the new marvel&mdash;namely,
capital. However, before
taking the last irreparable
step, he decided on a final trial. He
prepared the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise-en-scène</i> with due
completeness, and invited Mlle.
Claire to experiment on himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider me as one of the
public,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and give me a
hair-raiser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mlle. Claire protested that he
was too much behind the scenes;
but, on being pressed, she consented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to try, and asked Mr. Tappenham
to name his spirit.</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, and
then said, &ldquo;When I was a young
man, I knew a girl called Nellie
Davies&mdash;a pretty girl, my dear. I
dare say I didn&rsquo;t treat her over
well; but that&rsquo;s neither here nor
there. Let&rsquo;s have her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clever little Mlle. Claire asked
a question or two&mdash;and Mr. Tappenham
admired the neat and apparently
undesigned nature of her
questions&mdash;and then set to work,
after drawing the curtains a shade
closer, and turning the light a
trifle lower.</p>

<p>Mr. Tappenham sat comfortably
in an armchair, his hands
crossed over his white waistcoat,
and a smile of satisfaction on
his face. Presently the shadowy
shape began to form itself a yard
or two from Mr. Tappenham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Capital, capital!&rdquo; he chuckled.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll fetch &rsquo;em.&rdquo; The shape
grew more definite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will that do?&rdquo; asked Mlle.
Claire triumphantly. &ldquo;Is it like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, by Jove, it is rather!
Make it speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mlle. Claire laughed, and, projecting
her voice to the shape,
began in low, sweet, sad tones.
&ldquo;You summoned me. What do
you desire of your dead friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped, laughing again,
and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, when
you&rsquo;re up to it beforehand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tappenham did not answer
her. He sat looking at the shape,
and seemed to be listening intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I go on?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Tappenham took no notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;
thought Mlle. Claire. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t
go on if he&rsquo;s not listening.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Assuming her pretended voice
again, she said, &ldquo;I will try to forgive.
Farewell, farewell!&rdquo; and,
with a merry, boisterous laugh,
she displaced the arrangement
which produced the illusion, and
said to Mr. Tappenham:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now are you satisfied?&rdquo; Then
she added, in a tone of surprise,
&ldquo;Whatever is the matter?&rdquo; For,
as she looked, the expression of
his face changed from attention
to surprise, from surprise to uneasiness.
He turned to her and
said, with a forced smile, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
clever&mdash;a sight too clever. That&rsquo;ll
do; stop it, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve had enough. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
damned absurd, but it&rsquo;s getting
on my nerves. Stop it, I
say&mdash;stop it!&rdquo; His voice rose at
the end almost into a cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I have stopped it this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
three minutes!&rdquo; she answered in
surprise.</p>

<p>His eyes had wandered from
her to where the shape had been;
but at her last words he turned to
her again with a start. &ldquo;What?
No, no! No nonsense! Come,
now, be a good girl and stop it.
I&rsquo;ve had enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you drunk?&rdquo; asked Mlle.
Claire impatiently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be made a fool of,&rdquo;
said he angrily. &ldquo;Stop it, or not
a farthing do you get from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven bless the man, he&rsquo;s
mad!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, who
began to be a little uncomfortable
herself. It is an eerie thing to see
a man looking hard at&mdash;nothing,
and listening intently to&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>Suddenly he jumped up and
ran toward Mlle. Claire. He
seized her by the arm, and cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
&ldquo;Stop, you little devil, stop!
Do you want to madden me? I
never did it, I never did. At
least, I never meant it&mdash;so help
me, God, I never meant it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tappenham, you&rsquo;re
dreaming. There&rsquo;s nothing there.
I&rsquo;m saying nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming! she&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Take her
away! take her away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mlle. Claire looked at his face.
Then she too gave a shriek of
fright, and, hiding her face in her
hands, sank on the floor, sobbing.
She saw nothing. But what was
that face looking at?</p>

<p>As for Mr. Tappenham, he fled
into the corner of the room. And
when Mlle. Claire recovered herself
enough to draw back the curtains,
and let in the blessed sun,
he lay on the floor like a man
dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Mlle. Claire was a good girl.
She had a mother and two little
brothers to keep: so she stuck to
the business; but she never liked
it very much after that day. Mr.
Tappenham could afford to retire,
and he did retire. He lives very
quietly, and gives large sums in
charity. Mlle. Claire knows all
the tricks that ever were invented;
she is a thorough-going little skeptic,
and believes in nothing that
she does not see, and in very little
of what she does. Therefore she
merely exemplifies feminine illogicality
when she thinks to herself,
as she cannot help thinking
now and then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he did to Nellie
Davies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She told me about it, and I
believed her when she said that
she was not playing a trick on Mr.
Tappenham. But perhaps she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
was deceiving me also; if so, that
is an explanation.</p>

<p>I repeated the story to a scientific
man. He said that it furnished
an interesting instance of
the permanence of an optical impression
after the removal of the
external excitant. That is another
explanation.</p>

<p>Or it may have been the working
of conscience: that is an
explanation in a way, though an
improbable one, because, in spite
of many opportunities, Mr. Tappenham&rsquo;s
conscience had never
given him any inconvenience before.
It has since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A glorious story, which cannot be too warmly

<p>A very good novel.&mdash;<cite>The Nation.</cite></p>

<p>Mr. Ford&rsquo;s able political novel.&mdash;<cite>New York Times.</cite></p>

<p class="center f16">HON. PETER STIRLING,</p>

<p class="center f14">And what People thought of Him.</p>

<p class="center f12">By PAUL LEICESTER FORD.</p>

<p class="center f11">12mo. $1.50.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p><cite>The Nation</cite> further says he throws &ldquo;floods of
light on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d&rsquo;être</i>, origin, and methods of
the dark figure that directs the destinies of our
cities.... So strongly imagined and logically
drawn that it satisfies the demand for the appearance
of truth in art.... Telling scenes and
incidents and descriptions of political organization,
all of which are literal transcripts of life and
fact&mdash;not dry irrelevancies thrown in by way of
imparting information, but lively detail, needful
for a clear understanding of Stirling&rsquo;s progress
from the humble chairmanship of a primary to
the dictator&rsquo;s throne.... In the use of dramatic
possibilities, Mr. Ford is discreet and natural, and,
without giving Stirling a heroic pose, manages to
win for him very hearty sympathy and belief.
Stirling&rsquo;s private and domestic story is well knit
with that of his public adventures.&rdquo;</p>

<p><cite>The Literary World</cite> says: &ldquo;Of the mismanagement
and villainy practiced in the wards, of
bossism, obstructions to reform, wranglings and
riots, we have had more or less in fiction, but nothing
like this.... Pages which read like actual history....
A fine, tender love story.... A very
unusual, but, let us believe, a possible, character....
Peter Stirling is a man&rsquo;s hero.... Very
readable and enjoyable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><cite>The Boston Advertiser</cite> says: &ldquo;The book is
sure to excite attention and win popularity.&rdquo;</p>
